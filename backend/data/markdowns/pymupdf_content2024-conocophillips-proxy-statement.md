to maximize efficiencies and optimize well construction and completions designs to increase well recovery while minimizing incremental

business segment.

_Third, we accelerated our company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 and were_
_recognized by the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 for our methane reduction efforts._

In 2023, we demonstrated meaningful progress toward our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition, including by accelerating our Scope 1
and 2 GHG emissions-intensity reduction target from 40-50% to 50-60% gross operated emissions, using a 2016 baseline. We allocated a
portion of our budget for projects to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and advance low carbon opportunities, including carbon
capture and storage. In addition, we are in our second year of membership in the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) initiative,
which seeks to improve industry transparency in methane emissions reporting and encourage progress in reducing those emissions.
We were awarded the OGMP 2.0’s Gold Standard Pathway designation in recognition of our ambitious multi-year measurement-based
reporting plan which goes beyond current regulatory requirements. Additionally, 2023 marked the first year that Energy Transition
Milestones were included as a standalone metric in our Variable Cash Incentive Program, further demonstrating our commitment to our
net-zero operational emissions ambitions, by directly tying our performance on the Energy Transition Milestones to our compensation.

###### Looking to the Future

Now and into the future, we are focused on operational excellence with a proven track record of strong returns. Our strategy is
differential, and we believe our portfolio is the deepest, most durable and diverse of any of our peers. In addition, we are well
positioned for the energy transition. Safety remains a critical part of our culture, and we prioritize the safety of both our colleagues and
communities. That means continuously looking for ways to operate more safely, efficiently, and responsibly, with a focus on reducing
human error. We understand that this is a fundamental part of our license to operate.

_Your input is valued and your vote is very important._

We strongly believe that regular engagement with all stakeholders — stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers, advocacy groups,
governments, and communities — is critical to our long-term success. The Annual Meeting is an opportunity for stockholders to express
their views on ConocoPhillips’ business.

Whether or not you plan to participate in the Annual Meeting, and no matter how many shares you own, we encourage you to vote in
advance. Your vote is important to us and to our business. Prior to the meeting, you may sign and return your proxy card, use telephone

###### Executing on our Returns-Focused Value Proposition Delivers Strong Financial and Operational Performance

Throughout 2023, ConocoPhillips demonstrated that we can deliver strong financial and operational performance
consistent with our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles while executing against
our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand,
deliver competitive returns on and of capital to our stockholders, and focus on achieving our net-zero operational
emissions ambitions.

- _We delivered full year total and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 thousand barrels and 1,067 thousand barrels of oil_
_equivalent per day, respectively, while we continued to enhance our portfolio diversity by opportunistically acquiring the_
_remaining 50% working interest in Surmont, reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing our_
_global LNG strategy._

- _We achieved a 17 percent return on capital employed[(1)] and we delivered competitive returns of capital by distributing_
_$11 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion in cash through the ordinary dividend_
_and variable return of cash (“VROC”) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases._

- _We continued to demonstrate our commitment to our net-zero operational emissions ambition by accelerating our GHG_
_emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%[(2)] and we were awarded the Oil & Gas Methane_
_Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard Pathway designation._

We continue to be guided by our SPIRIT Values and remain committed to our foundational principles — focusing on
peer-leading distributions, maintaining a strong balance sheet, executing disciplined investment, and demonstrating
responsible and reliable ESG performance. Supporting these core principles are our strategic cash flow allocation
priorities: (1) invest enough capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend; (2) grow the dividend annually;
(3) maintain ‘A’ credit rating; (4) return greater than 30 percent of cash from operations to stockholders; and (5) make
disciplined investments to enhance returns.

A summary of the many important accomplishments we achieved in 2023 is shown below:

We maintained our ongoing practice of engaging with stockholders throughout 2023 and received consistent feedback
that our disciplined, returns-focused strategy is the right one for our business and that our stockholders appreciate our
ongoing efforts to increase the transparency and robustness of our disclosures to address the things that they care
about most.

#### Stockholder Engagement

ConocoPhillips understands the importance of maintaining a robust stockholder engagement program. During 2023,
ConocoPhillips continued this long-standing practice. Executives and management from our investor relations,
sustainable development, human resources, government affairs, and legal groups routinely engaged with stockholders
on a variety of topics, including our strategy and value proposition, corporate governance, executive compensation,
human capital management, culture, climate change, and sustainability. When appropriate, directors also met with
stockholders. We spoke with representatives from our top institutional investors, mutual funds, public pension funds,
labor unions, and socially responsible funds to hear their views on these important topics. Overall, investors expressed
strong support for ConocoPhillips. We believe our regular stockholder engagement was productive and provided an open
exchange of ideas and perspectives for both ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. For more information, see “Stockholder
_Engagement and Board Responsiveness” beginning on page_ 45 and “2023 Say on Pay Vote Result, Stockholder Engagement,
_and Board Responsiveness” beginning on page 69._

#### Governance Highlights

Our Board oversees the development and execution of our strategy. We have robust governance practices and
procedures that support our strategy. To maintain and enhance independent oversight, our Board is focused on its
composition and effectiveness and has implemented a number of measures for continuous improvement.

The measures outlined below align our corporate governance structure with our strategic objectives and enable the
Board to effectively communicate and execute our culture of compliance and rigorous risk management.

###### COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE PRACTICES

                            - Our Board is committed to regular renewal and refreshment, and we continually assess
whether our composition appropriately relates to ConocoPhillips’ current and evolving
strategic needs. See “Board Composition and Refreshment” beginning on page 33.

                            - In assessing Board composition, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs considers any planned

**Diverse,**
**Skilled Board** retirements from the Board, as well as background and diversity (including gender,

ethnicity, race, national origin, and geographic background).

                            - As a result, we have an experienced and diverse group of nominees. See “How Are
_Nominees Selected?” beginning on page 16._

                            - The Board balances its commitment to maintaining institutional knowledge with the need
for fresh perspectives that board refreshment and director succession planning provide.

**Balanced Board**
**Refreshment**    - Our Board’s thorough onboarding and director education processes complement our

recruitment process. See “Director Onboarding and Education” beginning on page 34.

                            - Our independent Lead Director’s robust duties are set forth in our Corporate Governance
Guidelines. See “Board Leadership Structure” beginning on page 36.

                            - Our non-employee directors meet privately in executive session at each regularly
scheduled Board meeting.

**Active**
**Independent**    - Our Board reviews CEO and senior management succession and development plans at

###### The governance best practices we have adopted support these general principles:


-----

#### Executive Compensation

###### Compensation Designed Around our Strategy and Informed by Stockholder Feedback

Our executive compensation programs and metrics are aligned with our Triple Mandate and directly tie to our strategic
priorities (see page 72). The following chart summarizes the principal components of our executive compensation program
(percentages are shown for each component of our CEO’s 2023 target compensation).


###### VARIABLE CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM (VCIP) 14%


###### SALARY 9%

- Market competitive; adjusted
for experience, responsibility
and performance

###### EXECUTIVE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 27%

- Long-term equity compensation
designed to encourage executive
retention and aligned with long-term
value creation for stockholders (35% of
long-term incentive value)

   - Settles in stock following 3rd
anniversary of grant date


Each year the HRCC, advised by its independent compensation consultant and informed by feedback from
stockholders, undertakes a rigorous process to review our programs. The HRCC believes a substantial portion of our
executive compensation should be equity-based and focused on rewarding long-term performance and furthermore,
that this approach most closely aligns the interests of our top executives with those of our stockholders (see page 67).
###### Compensation and Governance Practices

Through our robust process described under the heading “HRCC Annual Compensation Cycle” on page 78, the HRCC has
adopted strong governance practices consistent with the market, some of which are summarized below.

###### WHAT WE DO

% Executive compensation aligned with stockholder interests and primarily performance based (see
pages 72 & 74)

% “Double trigger” vesting after a change in control for long-term incentive awards (see page 94)

% Significant stock ownership guidelines (see page 95)

% Payouts capped on executive incentive programs

% ESG and Human Capital metrics tied to executive and employee compensation (see page 82)

% Executives’ incentive compensation subject to clawback policy (see page 95)

###### WHAT WE DON’T DO

No excise tax gross-ups for change in control plan participants

No current payment of dividend equivalents on unvested long-term incentives for executives

No repricing of stock options

No pledging, hedging, short sales, or derivative transactions

No employment agreements for our named executive officers (“NEOs”)

Don’t reward executives for excessive, inappropriate or unnecessary risk-taking

### Progress Report on Our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition

Since publishing our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (our “Plan”), we have continued to focus on implementing
our Climate Risk Strategy and advancing the Plan’s objectives. Our commitment to these efforts is demonstrated by our
achievements made to date — many of which have been completed ahead of schedule. As we achieve our goals, we finetune our strategy and refine our commitments through ongoing engagement with our key stakeholders.

The table below provides an update on how we are progressing against our Plan, including demonstrating our progress
and achievements in maintaining strategic flexibility, reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions, addressing Scope 3 emissions
and contributing to the energy transition.

###### 2023 PROGRESS REPORT

               - Continued focus on resilient low cost of supply and low GHG intensity resources that meet energy
transition pathway demand.

               - Published a new net-zero scenario modeling the collective global government and societal actions that
would be required to align with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.

               - Reduced methane intensity by ~70% since 2015.

               - Progressing toward near-zero methane intensity by 2030 (1.5 kg CO2e/BOE or approximately 0.15% of
natural gas produced).

               - Participated in OGMP 2.0 to improve methane measurement and reporting transparency and achieved the
Gold Standard Pathway for emissions reporting.

               - Invested in LongPath Technologies, a scalable laser-based continuous emissions monitoring solution with
the potential to cover targeted assets or provide basin-wide multi-operator coverage.

               - On schedule to meet the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring goal by the end of 2025.[(1) ]

               - Developing total flaring intensity target for 2030.

               - Accelerated our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 5060%, using a 2016 baseline for both gross operated and net equity emissions.

               - Completed our approved Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions projects and advanced low carbon
opportunities within the allotted capital and cost budget.

               - Participated in a Ceres-led Roundtable to discuss solutions for reaching net-zero emissions with crosssector participation from the financial sector and exploration and production (E&P) oil and gas companies.

               - Expanded third-party limited assurance to all sustainability disclosures in our Sustainability Report.

               - Continued to strengthen sustainability reporting processes, controls and assurance to prepare for pending
disclosure requirements.

               - Chaired a National Petroleum Council study on GHG emissions reduction across the U.S. natural gas
value chain.

               - Developed guidelines for company participation in the voluntary carbon market including
due diligence requirements.

               - Increased our investment in the Climate Asset Management Carbon Fund.

               - Continued to evaluate a wide range of future offset projects and funds to possibly diversify our portfolio.

(1) Per the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative Text, “Oil companies that endorse the Initiative will develop new oil fields they operate
according to plans that incorporate sustainable utilization or conservation of the field’s associated gas without routine flaring. Oil companies with
routine flaring at existing oil fields they operate will seek to implement economically viable solutions to eliminate this legacy flaring as soon as
possible, and no later than 2030.”


-----

- Hosted annual Supplier Sustainability Forum with a focus group of suppliers to identify opportunities
to reduce emissions in our value chain.

- Collaborated with industry groups and third-party partners to align on collection, reporting and
supplier engagement for supplier emissions.

- Secured regasification capacity at the Gate LNG terminal in the Netherlands.

- Secured 5 MTPA of LNG offtake along with 30% equity in Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project
on the U.S. Gulf Coast which began construction in March.

- Signed offtake agreements at Mexico Pacific’s Saguaro LNG and Energia Costa Azul export facility on
the west coast of Mexico.


We acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that GHG emissions from
the use of fossil fuels contribute to increases in global temperatures. We acknowledge the importance that
science places on limiting global average temperature increases to below 2-degree Celsius compared to
pre-industrial times, and to achieve that, science shows that global GHG emissions need to reach net-zero
in the second half of this century. We support the Paris Agreement as a welcomed global policy response to
that challenge.

We have had a public global climate change position since 2003. The position is reviewed periodically, agreed
to by the Executive Leadership Team, and then recommended to the Board.

### Item 1: Election of Directors  and Director Biographies

#### What am I Voting On?

You are voting on a proposal to elect the 12 nominees named in this Proxy Statement to one-year terms as
ConocoPhillips directors.

###### What is the makeup of the Board of Directors and how often are the members elected?

Our Board currently has 12 members. Directors are elected at the annual stockholder meeting each year. Any vacancy
on the Board created between annual stockholder meetings (if, for example, a current director resigns or the size of the
Board is increased) may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office. Any director appointed to
fill a vacancy would hold office until the next election.

Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors generally may not stand for reelection after they reach the age
of 72.

###### What if a nominee is unable or unwilling to serve?

All director nominees have consented to serve. However, should a director become unable or unwilling to serve before
the date of the Annual Meeting and should the Board not elect to reduce the size of the Board, shares represented by
proxies may be voted for a substitute nominated by the Board.

###### How are directors compensated?

Please see our discussion of director compensation beginning on page 53.

###### How are nominees selected?

The Committee on Directors’ Affairs regularly evaluates the size and composition of the Board and continually assesses
whether the composition appropriately relates to ConocoPhillips’ strategic needs, which change as the business
environment evolves. We seek director candidates who possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity,
and values and who are committed to representing the long-term interest of all ConocoPhillips’ stakeholders. As some
directors approach retirement age, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs seeks to onboard new directors to backfill
the needed skills and experience of outgoing directors with sufficient overlap in service to allow for the transfer of
institutional knowledge and sharing of experiences.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain director independence standards consistent with the standards
prescribed in the NYSE Listed Company Manual and provide that, at all times, at least a substantial majority of the
Board must meet those standards. The Committee on Directors’ Affairs also seeks to ensure that the Board reflects
a range of talents, ages, skills, personal attributes, and expertise — particularly in the areas of leadership and
management, financial reporting, issues specific to oil- and gas-related industries, both domestic and international
markets, public policy and government regulation, technology, public company board service, human capital
management, and environmental and sustainability matters — sufficient to provide sound and prudent guidance with
respect to ConocoPhillips’ strategic needs. The Board seeks to maintain a diverse membership and also requires
that its members be able to dedicate the time and resources necessary to ensure the diligent performance of their
duties, including attending Board and applicable committee meetings. To that end, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs
considers the number of other boards on which each candidate already serves. Non-employee directors may not
serve on more than four other boards of publicly-traded companies in addition to the Board, and ConocoPhillips' Chief
Executive Officer may not serve on the board of more than one other publicly-traded company. Directors should seek
approval from the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Committee on Directors’ Affairs in advance of accepting an
invitation to serve on another public company board.

The following are some of the key qualifications and skills the Committee on Directors’ Affairs considered in evaluating
the director nominees. The chart on the next page shows how these qualifications and skills are distributed among our
nominees. The individual biographies beginning on page 21 provide additional information about how each nominee’s
specific experiences, qualifications, and skills align with and further the strategic direction of ConocoPhillips.

committees of other large, publicly
traded companies provides an
understanding of corporate
governance practices and trends and
insights into: (1) board management;
(2) relations between the Board, the
CEO, and senior management; (3)
agenda setting; and (4) succession
planning. We believe this experience
supports our goals of strong board
and management accountability,
transparency, and protection of
stockholder interests.

business essentials and long-term
value creation for stockholders are
achieved with a responsible, sustainable
business model which fosters a
stable and healthy environment for
tomorrow and proactively addresses
stakeholder interests.


**HUMAN CAPITAL**

Generally, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs identifies candidates through business and organizational contacts of the
directors and management, though third-party search firms occasionally assist as well. Stockholders are also welcomed
to recommend director candidates for consideration. If you wish to recommend a candidate for nomination to the
Board, please follow the procedures described under “Submission of Future Stockholder Proposals and Nominations” on
page 129 for nominations made directly by a stockholder. Candidates recommended by stockholders are evaluated on
the same basis as all other candidates.

###### What vote is required to approve this proposal?

Each nominee requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting; the number of votes
cast “for” a director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that director. In a contested election (if the number
of nominees exceeded the number of directors to be elected), directors would be elected by a plurality of the shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

###### What if a Director Nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast?

If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at the Annual Meeting and no one else is elected in place of
that director, then, under Delaware law, the director continues to serve on the Board as a “holdover director.” However,
under our By-Laws, a holdover director is required to tender a resignation to the Board. The Committee on Directors’
Affairs then would consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it or whether some
other action should be taken. The Board would then make a decision, without participation by the holdover director. The
Board is required to disclose publicly (by a news release, filing with the SEC, or other broadly disseminated means of
communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind that decision within 90 days
from the date the election results are certified.


-----

###### Who are this year’s Director Nominees?

The following 12 directors are standing for election to hold office until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Each
of the director nominees is a current director. Committee membership is effective as of May 13, 2024.

#### Board Composition and Refreshment

We are continuously evaluating the overall balance of the Board,
including between longer-tenured directors with great institutional
knowledge and new directors with fresh external viewpoints. When
considering candidates to fill a vacancy on the Board, the priority is **Past 5 Years**
finding a candidate with the necessary skills and qualifications. In



addition, we believe the Board benefits from diversity of race, ethnicity,
gender, age, education, skills, cultural background, and professional
experiences. While our Board consists of diverse members, one of our
longstanding female directors recently retired and another longstanding **our Board**
female director resigned to more fully pursue other commitments. These
recent departures have resulted in less gender diversity in the Board's
current composition, which it is actively seeking to improve.


In 2023, the Board undertook a search for qualified female
candidates that could bring the right skills and experience to
enhance the Board’s composition. A number of candidates have
been reviewed and considered, and we are in the process of
selecting the right individual, including advanced discussions with
one candidate. A great deal of rigor and care is put into the Board
refreshment process, which requires time for director selection and
onboarding. Nonetheless, we are committed to onboarding at least
one new female director by the end of 2024.


As part of our Board’s commitment to regular renewal and refreshment:

- The Committee on Directors’ Affairs routinely and on an ongoing
basis assesses the Board’s composition, taking into consideration any
planned retirements for the Board, as well as background and diversity
(including gender, ethnicity, race, national origin, and geographic
background);

- We have implemented an annual Board and Committee assessment
process; and

- We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that state that
directors generally may not stand for re-election after they reach the
age of 72.

Five of the 12 director nominees have joined the Board in the past 5 years.
Almost 42 percent of our director nominees are women or racially/
ethnically diverse individuals. The average age of our director nominees is
63 and the average tenure of our director nominees is 6 years.


-----

#### Director Onboarding and Education

The Board has an orientation and onboarding program for new directors and provides continuing education for all
directors that is overseen by the Committee on Directors’ Affairs.


-----

#### Board and Committee Evaluations

Each year, the Board performs a rigorous full Board evaluation, and each director performs a self-evaluation and an
evaluation of each of his or her peers. Generally, the evaluation process described below is managed by the Corporate
Secretary’s office with oversight by the Committee on Directors’ Affairs. However, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs
periodically retains an independent third party to manage the evaluation process to ensure it remains as thorough and
transparent as possible.

###### 1 EVALUATION • Formal opportunity for directors to identify potential improvements QUESTIONNAIRES

                    - Solicit candid feedback from each director regarding the performance
and effectiveness of the Board, its committees, and individual directors

###### 2 INDIVIDUAL  • Lead Director has an in-depth conversation with each member of the Board INTERVIEWS

 3 REVIEW OF  • Lead Director reviews questionnaire and interview responses with FEEDBACK Committee on Directors’ Affairs

                    - Lead Director reviews questionnaire and interview responses with full
Board in executive session


###### 4 USE OF  • The Committee on Directors’ Affairs develops recommendations FEEDBACK

                    - The Committee on Directors’ Affairs and the Lead Director identify areas
for improvement of individual directors and of the Board as a whole



- **The Committee on Directors’ Affairs uses the results of individual**
**director evaluations as a part of the nomination process for the next**
**annual meeting**


###### 5 CHANGES  • As a result of this evaluation process, the Board has strengthened its IMPLEMENTED structure and procedures in the following ways over the past few years:

– achieved successful transitions of committee leadership roles;
– provided more materials as pre-read to improve efficiencies at meetings and allow
more time for discussion and deliberation;
– more robust committee reports to the full Board;
– individual director coaching; and
– added new highly skilled directors to enhance the Board’s composition.

In addition to participating in the full Board evaluation, members of each committee also complete a detailed
questionnaire annually to evaluate how well the committee is operating and to suggest improvements. Each committee’s
Chair summarizes the responses and reviews them with the members of his or her respective committee.

The Committee on Directors’ Affairs reviews these evaluation processes annually and develops any changes it deems
necessary to maintain best practices.

### Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips

The Committee on Directors’ Affairs and our Board annually review our governance structure, taking into account any
changes in Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) rules, as well
as current best practices. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines address the matters shown below, among others.

  - Director qualifications  - Director access to officers,  - Director orientation and continuing education

  - Director responsibilities employees, and independent advisors  - Chief Executive Officer evaluation and management

 - Board committees  - Director compensation and stock succession planning

ownership requirements                 - Board performance evaluations

The Corporate Governance Guidelines are posted on our website under “Investors > Corporate Governance” and are available
in print upon request (see “Available Information and Q&A about the Annual Meeting and Voting” beginning on page 130).
#### Board Leadership Structure

Robert A. Niblock

###### Annual Evaluation of Leadership Structure and Annual Election of Independent Lead Director

ConocoPhillips believes that independent board oversight is an essential component of strong corporate performance
and enhances stockholder value. The Board believes there is no single organizational model that is the best and most
effective in all circumstances. As a result, the Board periodically considers whether the offices of Chairman and CEO
should be combined or separated and who should serve in such capacities.

Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board chooses its Chairman based on what is in the best interest
of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. The Chairman and CEO may, but need not, be the same person. As part of its
annual review and evaluation process, the Board reviews its leadership structure and whether combining or separating
the roles of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that, in the event the Board determines that it is in the best interest of
ConocoPhillips and its stockholders for the offices of Chairman and CEO to be held by the same person (or in the event
the office of Chairman is not held by the CEO, but is nonetheless not independent), an independent lead director must
be selected from among the non-employee directors. The Board will continue to reexamine its corporate governance
policies and leadership structures on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet our needs.

For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring the
Board of Directors to amend the governing documents, as necessary, to separate the role of CEO and Chairman. After
evaluating the proposal, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs determined that it is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips
and its stockholders to maintain flexibility in our governing documents to allow the Board of Directors to determine
what organizational model best serves the interest of our company and its stockholders. The proposal failed to receive
significant support in 2023, with only approximately 25% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as
submitted. During engagements in 2023, stockholders were interested in learning about our leadership structure, and
appreciated hearing about how our board has the responsibility to review the governance structure on a regular and
ongoing basis, allowing for adaptability. Stockholders expressed support for the Board of Directors continuing to evaluate
whether the combined role of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of the Company.


-----

###### Why We Believe in Our Leadership Structure

In 2023, the Board reviewed our leadership structure and determined that continuing with a combined Chairman and
CEO, with our independent Lead Director, continues to be in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders.
The Board believes its current structure and processes ensure our Chairman and CEO is in a position to guide the Board
in setting priorities for ConocoPhillips and in addressing the risks and challenges we face, while also providing for

The Board consists of ten independent directors. Furthermore, each of the Audit and Finance, Human Resources and
Compensation, and Directors’ Affairs committees is made up entirely of independent directors. The Chairs of the Board’s
committees establish their agendas and review their committee materials in advance of meetings, conferring with other
directors and members of management as each deems appropriate. Moreover, each director is free to suggest agenda
items and to raise matters that are not on the agenda at Board and committee meetings. Our Corporate Governance
Guidelines require our Lead Director to preside over an executive session of the non-employee directors at every
meeting. Each executive session may include a discussion of the performance of the Chairman and CEO, matters
concerning the relationship of the Board with the Chairman and CEO and other members of senior management,
and such other matters as the non-employee directors deem appropriate. In addition, our Lead Director presides
over a meeting of our independent directors at least once a year as required by the NYSE rules. No formal action of
the Board is taken at these meetings, although the non-employee directors may subsequently recommend matters
for consideration by the full Board. The Board may invite guest attendees for the purpose of making presentations,
responding to questions by the directors, or providing counsel on specific matters within their areas of expertise.


-----

#### Board Independence

The Corporate Governance Guidelines contain director independence standards that are consistent with the standards
set forth in the NYSE Listed Company Manual to assist the Board in determining the independence of ConocoPhillips’
non-employee directors. Under such standards, the Board has determined that all non-employee directors meet the
standards regarding independence set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and are free of any material
relationship with ConocoPhillips (either directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization that
has a relationship with ConocoPhillips). In making such determination, the Board specifically considered the fact that
many of our directors may be directors, retired officers, and stockholders of companies with which we conduct business.
In addition, some of our directors may serve as employees of, or consultants or advisors to, companies that do business
with ConocoPhillips and its affiliates. In all cases, the Board determined that the nature of the business conducted and
the interest of the director by virtue of such position were immaterial both to ConocoPhillips and to the director.

In recommending that each non-employee director is independent, our Board, with input from the Committee on
Directors’ Affairs, considered relationships that, while not constituting related-party transactions in which a director had
a direct or indirect material interest, nonetheless involved transactions between ConocoPhillips and a company with
which a director is affiliated, whether through employment status or by virtue of serving as a director. Included in the
Committee’s review were the following transactions, which occurred in the ordinary course of business. In all instances,
it was determined that the nature of the business conducted and the dollar amounts involved were immaterial, both to
ConocoPhillips and the relevant counterparty, and fell within independence standards set forth in the ConocoPhillips
Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

**Director** **Matters Considered**

**Gay Huey Evans CBE** Ordinary course business transactions with Standard Chartered plc and S&P Global Inc.

**David T. Seaton** Ordinary course business transactions with Boston Consulting Group, The Mosaic
Company, and the National Association of Manufacturers

#### Related Party Transactions

In accordance with SEC and NYSE rules, we maintain a policy on related party transactions (“Related Party Transaction
Policy”), which requires the Audit and Finance Committee to review all Reportable Related Party Transactions in
advance. A Reportable Related Party Transaction is a transaction, arrangement, or relationship (or series of similar
transactions, arrangements, or relationships) in which:

- We (or one of our subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant;

- The aggregate amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any fiscal year; and

- Any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of ConocoPhillips’ last fiscal year was, an executive officer,
director, director nominee, or holder of at least 5 percent of our equity securities (each a “Covered Person”), or any of
such Covered Person’s immediate family members, had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

In accordance with the Related Party Transaction Policy, Covered Persons are required to identify business and
financial affiliations involving themselves or their immediate family members that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to a Reportable Related Party Transaction. Based on this information, our legal staff, in consultation with the finance
team, performs the necessary diligence to determine whether any such Reportable Related Party Transaction exists
or will exist, once completed. Upon determining that a transaction is or will be a Reportable Related Party Transaction,
the General Counsel presents all relevant facts and circumstances to the Audit and Finance Committee, which reviews
transactions for materiality and determines whether the transaction is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips, before
either approving or disapproving it. In making its decision, the Audit and Finance Committee considers whether the
transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third
party and the extent of the Covered Person’s interest in the transaction, taking into account the conflicts of interest
provisions of ConocoPhillips’ Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and such other factors as it believes are relevant.
The Audit and Finance Committee shall prohibit any transactions that it determines are inconsistent with the interests
of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders.

The Audit and Finance Committee approved the following Reportable Related Party Transactions:

Cameron J. Smith, son-in-law of William L. Bullock, Jr., our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, was
employed in a non-executive position. The aggregate value of the compensation paid to Mr. Smith during fiscal year
2023 was approximately $346,312, consisting of salary, annual incentive (earned in fiscal 2023 and paid in fiscal
2024), and restricted stock unit awards. In addition, Mr. Smith received the standard benefits provided to other nonexecutive ConocoPhillips employees for his services during fiscal year 2023.

Timothy A. Leach serves as a director and also an employee of the company, but not as an executive officer.
Mr. Leach receives compensation from the company for the services he provides as an employee. Mr. Leach does not
receive any additional compensation for his service as a director. The compensation he received as an employee is
summarized in footnote 1 beginning on page 55.


-----

#### Board Meetings and Committees

The Board met five times in 2023. Each director attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of the Board and
applicable committee meetings held in 2023.

The Board has five standing committees: (1) the Executive Committee; (2) the Audit and Finance Committee; (3) the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee; (4) the Committee on Directors’ Affairs; and (5) the Public Policy
and Sustainability Committee. The Board determined that all of the members of the Audit and Finance Committee, the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee, the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, and the Committee
on Directors’ Affairs are independent directors within the meaning of SEC regulations, the listing standards of the NYSE,
and ConocoPhillips’ Corporate Governance Guidelines. Each committee, other than the Executive Committee, conducts
an annual self-evaluation as described under “Board and Committee Evaluations” on page 35. The charters for our
standing committees can be found on ConocoPhillips’ website at www.conocophillips.com under “Investors > Corporate
_Governance > Committees.” Stockholders may request printed copies of these charters by following the instructions_
under “Available Information and Q&A About the Annual Meeting and Voting” beginning on page 130.

#### Board Oversight of Risk Management

The Board has broad oversight for our risk-management programs. In this role, the Board is responsible for ensuring
that the risk-management processes designed and implemented by management are functioning as intended and that
necessary steps are taken to foster a culture of prudent decision-making throughout the organization.

In order to maintain effective Board oversight across the entire enterprise, the Board delegates to individual committees
certain elements of its oversight function, as shown below. In addition, the Board delegates authority to the Audit
and Finance Committee to manage the risk oversight efforts of the various committees. As part of this authority, the
Audit and Finance Committee regularly discusses ConocoPhillips’ enterprise risk-management policies and facilitates
appropriate coordination among committees to ensure that our risk-management programs are functioning properly.
The Board receives regular updates from its committees on individual categories of risk, including strategy, reputation,
operations, climate change, people, technology, investment, political, legislative, regulatory, and market, and receives a
report periodically from the Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee about oversight efforts and coordination.

###### Senior Management

ConocoPhillips’ senior management is responsible for day-to-day management of risk, including designing
and implementing risk management processes and policies to address the various exposures to risk. Senior
management regularly reports to the Board and its committees on a variety of risks.

Our comprehensive risk governance framework extends from the Board of Directors through executive and senior
management to the working levels in each of our business units (BUs). This framework provides oversight of our
sustainable development positions and related strategic planning and risk management policies and procedures.

We use a management system approach to assess, and manage sustainability risks, including climate, nature and
social-related risks. This system links directly to the enterprise risk management process, which includes an annual risk
review by executive leadership and the Board.

#### Stockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness

ConocoPhillips is committed to engaging in constructive and meaningful conversations with stockholders and to
building and managing long-term relationships based on mutual trust and respect. The Board values the input and
insights of our stockholders and believes that consistent and effective Board-stockholder communication strengthens
the Board’s role as an active, informed, and engaged fiduciary.

###### Board Oversight of Engagement

In an effort to continuously improve ConocoPhillips’ governance processes and communications, the Committee on
Directors’ Affairs has adopted Board and Shareholder Communication and Engagement Guidelines. Recognizing that
director attendance at the annual meeting provides stockholders with a valuable opportunity to communicate with
Board members, we expect directors to attend. In 2023, all of the directors standing for reelection participated in the
annual meeting. We anticipate that all of the director nominees will participate in the Annual Meeting in May. We also
support an open and transparent process for stockholders and other interested parties to contact the Board in between
annual meetings as noted under “Communications with the Board of Directors” on page 53.

###### THE BOARD-DRIVEN STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS


**DELIBERATE, ASSESS, AND**
**PREPARE**

The Board regularly assesses
and monitors investor sentiment,
stockholder voting results,
and trends in governance,
executive compensation, human
capital management, culture,
regulatory, environmental, social,
and other matters. With that
foundation, the Board identifies
and prioritizes potential topics
for stockholder engagement.


**REACH OUT AND ENGAGE**

Management regularly meets
with stockholders to actively
solicit input on a range of
issues and reports stockholder
views to our Board. With
management’s assistance, and
when appropriate, members of
the Board will engage in dialogue
with stockholders, which
clarifies and deepens the Board’s
understanding of stockholder
concerns and provides
stockholders with insight into our
Board’s processes.


**EVALUATE AND RESPOND**

Stockholder input informs
our Board’s ongoing process
of continually improving
governance and other practices.
Specifically, the Board and
management regularly review
stockholder input to evaluate
any identified issues and
concerns. The Board responds
to stockholders, as appropriate,
with continued discussion
and enhancements to policy,
practices, and disclosure.


-----

###### Ongoing Engagement and Board Reporting

Executives and management from ConocoPhillips’ investor relations, sustainable development, human resources,
government affairs, and legal groups and, when appropriate, directors meet with stockholders regularly on a variety
of topics. Management provides reports to the Board and its committees regarding the key themes and results of
these conversations, including typical investor concerns and questions, emerging issues, and pertinent corporate
governance matters.

In 2023, we actively reached out to investors owning more than 50 percent of our stock to invite them to participate in
in-depth discussions with our engagement team. We gained valuable feedback during these discussions, which was
shared with the Board and its relevant committees.

###### Board Responsiveness

Our Board is committed to constructive engagement with investors. We regularly evaluate and respond to the views
expressed by our stockholders. This dialogue has led to enhancements in our corporate governance, environmental,
social, and executive compensation activities that the Board believes are in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and
our stockholders.


-----

-----

#### Code of Business Ethics and Conduct

ConocoPhillips has adopted a worldwide Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, which applies to all directors, officers,
and employees. The Code of Business Ethics and Conduct is designed to help resolve ethical issues in an increasingly
complex global business environment and covers topics such as conflicts of interest, insider trading, competition and
fair dealing, discrimination and harassment, confidentiality, payments to government personnel, anti-boycott laws,
U.S. embargoes and sanctions, compliance procedures, employee complaint procedures, expectations for supervisors,
internal investigations, use of social media, and money laundering. In accordance with good corporate governance
practices, we periodically review and revise the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct as necessary.

The Code of Business Ethics and Conduct is posted on our website under “Investors > Corporate Governance.” Any
amendments to the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct or waivers of it for our directors and executive officers will
be posted on our website promptly to the extent required by law. Stockholders may request printed copies of our Code
of Business Ethics and Conduct by following the instructions located under “Available Information and Q&A About the
_Annual Meeting and Voting” beginning on page 130._

#### Commitment to Our Culture

We believe our performance is not merely about what we do, but how we do it. The way we do our work is what sets us
apart and drives our performance. We run our business under a set of guiding principles we call our SPIRIT Values —
Safety, People, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovation, and Teamwork. See “Human Capital Management” on page 49.

We know that our people are one of our greatest assets. Our reputation and integrity require that each employee, officer,
director, and those working on our behalf maintain personal responsibility for ethical business conduct. We respect one
another and have created an inclusive environment that reflects the different backgrounds, experiences, ideas, and
perspectives of our employees. We recognize that a strong corporate culture is critical to our long-term success. Senior
management is influential in defining and shaping our corporate culture and sets the expectations and tone for an
ethical work environment. Our Board also provides valuable oversight in assessing and monitoring our corporate culture.
ConocoPhillips has a long-standing commitment to ensuring respectful, fair, and nondiscriminatory treatment for all
employees and maintaining a workforce that is free from all forms of unlawful conduct.

#### Human Capital Management

Our strategy, our performance, our culture, and our reputation are fueled by our world-class workforce. The diverse
people of ConocoPhillips have always been the heart of our company, and we recognize that attracting, retaining, and

###### A Compelling Culture

How we do our work is what sets us apart and drives our performance. We are experts in what we do and continuously
find ways to do our jobs better. Our different backgrounds, ideas and views drive our success. Together, we deliver
strong performance, but not at all costs. We embrace our core cultural attributes that are found across the organization.

###### Spotlight Story: Lower 48 Program Ensures Mental Wellness Support Is Just a Colleague Away

Mental health matters. To ensure employees have access to resources designed to support their mental health
needs, the Lower 48 business unit launched the Mental Health Allyship Program in 2023. As part of this program,
22 employee volunteers serve as Mental Health Allies (“Allies”) to serve as a first point of contact, directing
colleagues to internal resources, like the company’s Employee Assistance Program or outside resources in their
area. Supported by the company’s mental health experts, Allies have received training to recognize when someone
may be struggling or experiencing a decline in their mental well-being. While not professional counselors, Allies
help “get the conversation started.” Programs like this help us continue to build an inclusive and diverse work
environment that embraces our SPIRIT Values.

###### ADVANCING OUR DEI JOURNEY

As our industry evolves, we’ll continue to face both new opportunities and challenges. So, we’ll need the best and
brightest people who bring passion and excitement for solving important problems. We also need to cultivate an
environment where everyone is encouraged and able to contribute — no matter their role, level or location. This is how
innovation thrives, leading to better business outcomes. That is why we’ve put an emphasis on — and are committed to —
elevating DEI and creating a great place to work.

At ConocoPhillips, we believe our unique differences power the future of energy. Our DEI vision is to foster an inclusive
culture that values the rich mixture of backgrounds, identities, and workstyles of our people, built on equitable practices
that support all employees in unlocking their full potential. Our commitment to DEI is foundational to our SPIRIT
Values and to achieving our business objectives. All employees play a part in creating and sustaining an inclusive work
environment because everyone benefits from DEI.

The ELT has ultimate accountability for advancing our DEI commitments through a governance structure that includes
a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), a dedicated DEI organization, and a global DEI Council consisting of senior leaders
from across the company. The company sets goals and measures progress based on a transparent DEI strategy with
four pillars that guide our focus and approach: people, programs and processes, culture, and our external brand and
reputation. All company leaders are accountable for advancing DEI through local efforts. Our DEI efforts and progress
are regularly reviewed with the Board.

Our 2023 focus was on building clarity and connection. Over the course of the year, the CDO and DEI organization
sought to align leaders and employees across the company to the refreshed DEI strategy. Highlights from our 2023 DEI
accomplishments include:

- Launching our refreshed DEI strategy;

- Reviewing the results of the 2023 Perspectives survey and continuing to integrate the insights into our DEI efforts;

- Updating governance and membership for both global and business unit and functional DEI Councils;

- Enhancing our Employee Networks by clarifying their strategic intent and creating a consistent sponsorship structure;

- Hosting workshops tailored to business units to further educate on the definitions of DEI; and

- Developing a training called DEI Foundations and launching it to senior leadership.


-----

We know that for DEI to be sustainable, we need programs and processes that are disciplined, and promote fair,
consistent, and equitable treatment of all employees. By ensuring equity in our people-related programs and processes,
we can help advance DEI within the company. Some of our focus areas include:

- Performance management: Assigning all employees a “how” rating as part of our performance management process
to hold our workforce and our leaders accountable for behaviors, including those that advance DEI.

- Recognition: Awarding a prestigious SPIRIT of Performance Award for DEI advocates.

- Employee Networks: Sponsoring broad participation in our extensive Employee Networks and aligning their work to
our DEI pillars.

###### Spotlight Story:

 LIFT off!

In March 2023, more than 130 petrotechnical employees from around the world gathered in Houston for a
special learning event, Learning and Innovation for Today and Tomorrow or “LIFT.” LIFT originated in 2019 and is
a technical training event for global petrotechnical professionals designed to promote employee engagement,
foster innovation, reinforce leadership skills, and drive cross-discipline collaboration and networking.

LIFT participants came from a variety of backgrounds and business units, ranging from Geoscience to HSE,
and Lower 48 to Qatar. Early and mid-career employees were nominated to participate in the program to build
knowledge and expand their networks.

Participants left with new problem-solving techniques and enhanced communications skills to help convey
complex, technical ideas. Importantly, participants formed connections with peers across the globe.

###### Attracting a World-Class Workforce

Our success depends on having the right workforce to meet our business needs. Attracting a skilled, engaged, and
diverse workforce is a top priority. We have taken significant actions to embed equity and inclusion into our recruiting
practices, from adapting the way we construct job descriptions to striving for our recruiting pipelines to reflect the
diversity of the communities in which we operate. To attract top talent for full-time positions and internships, we recruit
from a number of universities in the U.S. By attending conferences and recruiting at Hispanic-serving institutions and
HBCUs, we continue broadening our pipeline of talent. We closely monitor recruitment metrics through our university
and experienced hire dashboards in areas such as gender, ethnicity, and acceptance rates to observe the diversity
composition of the candidate pool from application to offer. In addition, voluntary attrition metrics are routinely tracked
and disclosed to guide our retention activities, as necessary. We believe our Employee Networks, our emphasis on talent
development, and our commitment to DEI, create an environment that promotes retention of our workforce.

###### Valuing our People

 EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT

Developing our world-class workforce is a critical focus for ConocoPhillips. We want employees to feel valued and
to add value. Our workforce is developed through a combination of on-the-job learning, formal training, and regular
feedback and mentoring. Skill-based TMTs guide employee development and career progression by skills and
location. The TMTs help identify our future business needs and assess the availability of critical skill sets within
ConocoPhillips. Annually, business leadership and TMTs meet to review succession benches, calibrate talent, and
provide recommendations to executive leadership and the Board on future leadership roles that will promote business
continuity. We use a performance management program focused on objectivity, credibility, and transparency. The
program includes broad stakeholder feedback, real-time recognition, and a formal rating to assess behaviors to ensure
they are in line with our SPIRIT Values. Supervisors have access to a voluntary 360-feedback tool to receive feedback
on their strengths and opportunities relative to these competencies. We also offer training on a broad range of technical
and professional skills, from data analytics to communication skills.

Taking steps to measure and assess employee satisfaction and engagement is at the heart of long-term business
success and creating a great place to work for our global workforce. Since 2019, the ConocoPhillips Perspectives
Survey has been our primary listening platform for gathering feedback on employee sentiment and strengthening
our “Who We Are” culture. Leaders analyze the survey data and comments and then identify focus areas for action
at both the enterprise and local level. In 2023, our Perspectives survey touched on key themes related to employee
satisfaction, company strategy, leadership, career development, DEI, and well-being. We transparently share our survey
results internally with global employees, and we also disclose key metrics externally in our HCM report. We look for
incremental progress on key drivers of employee satisfaction over time and leverage global and industry benchmark
data to help provide transparency on our internal metrics against our peers.

###### COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

The HRCC oversees many of our employee compensation programs. Our compensation programs are competitive
with local markets and are comprised of a base pay rate, the annual Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”) and, for
eligible employees, the Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) program. From the CEO to the frontline worker, every employee
participates in VCIP, which aligns employee compensation with ConocoPhillips’ success on critical performance
metrics and also recognizes individual performance. Our RSU program is designed to attract and retain employees,
reward performance, and align employee interest with stockholders by encouraging stock ownership. Our retirement
and savings plans are intended to support employees’ financial futures and are competitive within local markets. Our
benefits program provides coverage for families requiring disability support, elder care, and child care, including onsite
child care, where access locally is a challenge.

#### Director Compensation

Our non-employee director compensation program consists primarily of an equity component and a cash component,
which is detailed below.

###### Objectives and Principles

The Board’s goal in designing non-employee director compensation is to provide a competitive program that will enable
us to attract and retain highly skilled individuals with relevant experience to oversee ConocoPhillips’ strategic direction.
Our compensation program also reflects the time and talent required to serve on the board of a complex, multinational
corporation. The Board seeks to provide sufficient flexibility in the form of compensation to meet directors’ varying
needs while ensuring that a substantial portion of compensation is linked to the long-term success of ConocoPhillips.

The Board approves levels of compensation after a recommendation from the Committee on Directors’ Affairs, which
conducts an annual review with an independent compensation consultant. In 2023, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs
met with an independent compensation consultant to review the non-employee director compensation program and
to determine whether to recommend any changes to that program. The review included comparisons of director
compensation levels with the compensation reference group. See “Process for Determining Executive Compensation —
_Setting Target Compensation — Compensation Reference Group” beginning on page 79. The consultant noted that our_
director compensation program was within the limits set out in the stockholder-approved 2023 Omnibus Stock and
Performance Incentive Plan under which director awards are made. Effective July 1, 2023, the Board approved, on the
basis of benchmarking data, the following compensation changes:

- Increase the cash compensation for the Lead Director from $45,000 to $50,000

- Increase the cash compensation for the Chair of the Committee on Directors’ Affairs from $15,000 to $20,000


-----

###### Equity Compensation

Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of restricted stock units with an aggregate value of $220,000 on the
date of grant. The restricted stock units are fully vested at grant and are credited with dividend equivalents in the form
of additional restricted stock units, but they cannot be sold or otherwise transferred. In the case of any newly elected
directors, the initial annual equity grant is prorated for the year of election from and including the month of election.

Prior to each annual grant, a director may elect the schedule on which the transfer restrictions will lapse. When
restrictions lapse, a director will receive unrestricted shares of ConocoPhillips stock in exchange for his or her restricted
stock units. Regardless of the schedule a director elects, all restrictions on a director’s restricted stock units will lapse
in the event of the director’s retirement, disability, or death, or upon a change in control of ConocoPhillips, unless the
director has elected to defer receipt of the shares until a later date. Directors forfeit restricted stock units if, before
restrictions lapse (and prior to any change in control), the Board finds sufficient cause for forfeiture.

###### Cash Compensation

The non-employee director compensation program, as approved by the Board, consists of the following cash compensation:

- Non-employee director annual cash compensation — $115,000

- Lead Director — $50,000[(1)]

- Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee — $35,000

- Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee — $27,500

- Chair of the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee — $27,500

- Chair of the Committee on Directors’ Affairs — $20,000[(1)]

- All other Audit and Finance Committee members — $10,000

- All other Human Resources and Compensation Committee members — $7,500

- All other Public Policy and Sustainability Committee members — $7,500

- All other Committee on Directors’ Affairs members — $5,000

This cash compensation is payable in monthly installments. Each director may elect, on an annual basis, to receive all
or part of the cash compensation in unrestricted stock or restricted stock units or to have the amount credited to a
deferred compensation account. Any such unrestricted stock or restricted stock units will be issued on the last business
day of each month and valued using the average of the high and the low market prices of ConocoPhillips common stock
on such date. The restricted stock units issued in lieu of cash compensation are subject to the same restrictions as the
annual restricted stock units described under “Equity Compensation” above.

(1) For the period January 2023 to June 2023, the additional cash compensation for the Lead Director and Chair of Committee on Directors’ Affairs was
$45,000 and $15,000, respectively.

###### Deferral of Compensation

Non-employee directors can elect to defer their cash compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan for NonEmployee Directors of ConocoPhillips (“Director Deferral Plan”). Deferred amounts are deemed to be invested in various
mutual funds and similar investment choices, including ConocoPhillips common stock, as selected by the director from
a prescribed list.

###### Matching Gift Program

Active non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Matching Gift Program. This program
provides a dollar-for-dollar match of a donation of cash or securities (up to a maximum of $10,000 annually per donor) to
tax-exempt charities and educational institutions, excluding religious, political, fraternal, or athletic organizations. The
Board believes the Matching Gift Program is consistent with ConocoPhillips’ commitment to social responsibility.


-----

###### Other Compensation

We provide transportation or reimburse the cost of transportation when a non-employee director travels on
ConocoPhillips business, including to attend meetings of the Board or a committee. From time to time, spouses and
other guests of directors may be invited to attend certain meetings at the request of the Board. The Board believes this
creates a collegial environment that enhances the effectiveness of the Board. If spouses or other guests are invited to
attend meetings, ConocoPhillips reimburses directors for the out-of-pocket cost of the additional travel and related
incidental expenses. Any such reimbursement is treated by the Internal Revenue Service as taxable income to the
applicable director. Non-employee directors do not receive gross-ups to compensate for the resulting income taxes
except in connection with the presentation of a retirement gift.

###### Stock Ownership

Each non-employee director is expected to own ConocoPhillips stock in the amount of the aggregate annual equity
grants received during his or her first five years on the Board. Directors are expected to reach this level of target
ownership within five years after joining the Board. Actual shares of stock, restricted stock, or restricted stock units,
including deferred stock units, may be counted in satisfying the stock ownership guidelines. The holdings of each of our
directors currently meet or exceed these guidelines.

(1) Ryan Lance and Timothy Leach serve as directors and also as employees of ConocoPhillips. They are not included in this table because all of the
compensation they receive from the company is for services they provide as employees; they do not receive any additional compensation for their
services as directors. The compensation Mr. Lance received as an employee is summarized starting on page 98. Mr. Leach is not an executive officer,
and the compensation he received as an employee in 2023 is summarized below.

     - Salary: $723,348[(a)]

     - Bonus: $1,500,000[(b)]

     - Stock Awards: $2,201,851[(c)]

     - Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation: $780,492[(d)]

     - Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings: $0

     - All Other Compensation: $377,660[(e)]

     - Total: $5,583,351


-----

(a) Includes any amounts that were voluntarily deferred under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan.

(b) Includes the first installment of the payment due under the non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality agreement as outlined in Exhibit
10.1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2022. If Mr. Leach breaches this agreement, he is required to repay
any amounts previously paid to him under the agreement.

(c) Amount represents the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made under the Performance Share Program (“PSP”) and the Executive
Restricted Stock Unit Program (“ERSUP”), as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See the “Employee Benefit Plans” section
of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the
relevant assumptions used in this determination. For the awards granted for PSP 23 and for 2023 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the
ERSUP, the grant date fair value was $112.50, but as noted in the Equity Grant Practices outlined on page 95 awards are granted using the
average of the closing prices on the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant ($112.658). The difference between these values can increase
or decrease the reported amounts from year to year even if target compensation does not change. For 2023, Mr. Leach received a grant
of 6,835 RSUs under the ERSUP with a value of $768,938. Mr. Leach received a target grant of 12,737 performance stock units for PSP 23
for the January 2023 – December 2025 performance period with a value of $1,432,913. The PSP grant is valued at target because it is most
probable at the setting of the target for the applicable performance periods that targets will be achieved. If payout was made at maximum
levels for company performance the number of performance stock units and value would double from the target, although the value of the
actual payout would be dependent upon the stock price and accrued dividend equivalent units at the time of the payout. If payout was made at
minimum levels, the number of performance stock units and value would be reduced to zero.

(d) The amount shown includes amounts paid under the Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”).

(e) Includes $107,926 related to pre-approved personal travel on company aircraft, based on the approximate aggregate incremental cost to
ConocoPhillips for such personal use, including travel for any family member or personal guest. Approximate aggregate incremental cost has
been determined by calculating the variable costs for each aircraft during the year, dividing that amount by the total number of miles flown
by that aircraft, and multiplying the result by the miles flown for personal use during the year. However, where there were identifiable costs
related to a particular trip — such as fuel, airport landing fees or food and lodging for aircraft personnel who remained at the location of the
personal trip — those amounts are separately determined and included. The amounts shown include incremental costs associated with flights
to the hangar or other locations without passengers (commonly referred to as “deadhead” flights) arising from the non-business use of the
aircraft. Mr. Leach has entered into an aviation lease agreement with the company under which reimbursement, subject to FAA limitations,
is provided for certain flights which are personal in nature. Amounts included reflect aggregate incremental cost net of reimbursements.
Lease reimbursements are allocated to the flight to which they relate but may be paid in a different year due to lease administration. Also
includes $4,349 for the aggregate incremental cost of premiums paid by ConocoPhillips for executive group life insurance (coverage equal
to two times annual salary) versus the cost of basic life insurance provided to non-executive employees (coverage equal to annual salary).
Also includes $59,400 of company contributions under the company’s tax qualified savings plan. Under the terms of its tax-qualified defined
contribution plan, ConocoPhillips makes matching contributions and nonelective allocations to the accounts of its eligible employees,
including Mr. Leach. Mr. Leach is fully vested in his benefits under the company’s tax-qualified defined contribution plan. Also includes
$126,641 of company contributions to non-qualified defined contribution plans. Under the terms of its nonqualified defined contribution plans,
ConocoPhillips makes contributions to the accounts of its eligible employees, including Mr. Leach. His contributions under the nonqualified
defined contribution plans include matching and company retirement (in lieu of pension) contributions that cannot be made to the company’s
tax qualified defined contribution plan due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Mr. Leach is fully vested in his benefit under
the company’s nonqualified defined contribution plans. The company’s defined contribution nonqualified deferred compensation plans allow
hypothetical investment of deferred amounts in a broad range of mutual funds or other market-based investments, including ConocoPhillips
stock. As market-based investments, none of these provide above-market return. Also includes $4,730 of other perquisites and personal
benefits including the cost of presentations made to employees and their spouses at company meetings or events, reimbursements for the
cost of spousal and other guests attendance at such meetings or events, and the aggregate incremental cost of any other personal benefits
or perquisites not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive’s duties arising from such presentations, meetings, or
events, primarily food, drink and transportation. Also includes $60,780 in security costs, primarily related to protection services provided
under our Comprehensive Security Program if a risk assessment indicated that enhanced procedures were warranted. Amounts also include
$13,834 for tax gross up payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the employee. These taxes arise primarily when
ConocoPhillips requests family members or other guests to accompany the employee to a function, and, as a result, the employee is deemed
to make a personal use of company assets (for example, when a spouse accompanies an employee on a company aircraft). ConocoPhillips
believes such expenses are appropriately characterized as a business expense, and, if the employee has imputed income in accordance with
the applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips will generally reimburse any increased tax costs.

As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Leach had 26,439[(i) ]Shares or Units of Stock that Have Not Vested and 51,039[(ii) ]Equity Incentive Plan Awards:
Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested. Outstanding equity awards made to Mr. Leach include long-term
incentive awards payable under the PSP and long-term time-vested awards under the ERSUP. Awards continue to have restrictions upon
transferability. The market value of these awards as of December 31, 2023 (see footnotes i and ii below) is based on a market value of $116.07
per share (the closing stock price of the company’s common stock on December 29, 2023). The number of shares or units shown is rounded
to the nearest whole share, but the related value is based on the actual number of shares (including fractional shares), with aggregate value
rounded to the nearest dollar.

(i) Includes 19,624 RSUs related to the grant in 2022 under the ERSUP and 6,815 RSUs related to the grant in 2023 under the ERSUP. These
awards have a market value as of December 31, 2023, of $3,068,804. Under the ERSUP, stock awards are made in the form of RSUs. The
terms and conditions of those units require restriction on transferability, which lapse three years from the anniversary of the grant date.
Forfeiture is expected to occur at separation from service if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after
the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to
waive forfeiture. Upon lapse of restrictions, settlement is made in stock. RSUs have no voting rights. Dividend equivalents, if any, on RSUs
held are reinvested in additional RSUs. Dividend equivalents are paid at the same time and the same rate as dividends on common stock are
paid, not at a preferential rate.

(ii) Includes 37,849 target performance unit awards under the PSP for the ongoing performance period beginning January 2022 and
13,189 target performance unit awards under the PSP for the ongoing performance period beginning January 2023. Based on target
performance, these awards have a market value as of December 31, 2023, of $5,924,055. There is no assurance that these awards will
be granted at, below, or above target after the end of the relevant performance periods because determination of whether to make an
actual grant to, and the amount of any actual grant for Mr. Leach is within the discretion of the HRCC. Mr. Leach’s awards under the PSP
are made in the form of performance stock units that are subject to restrictions on transferability that lapse three years after the grant
date. Forfeiture is expected to occur if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has
reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. The
awards will be settled in cash and have no voting rights. The awards accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period,
are reinvested in additional performance stock units. Dividends or dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates, and dividend
equivalents are paid at the same time as dividends on common stock.

In 2023, Mr. Leach had 70,918 shares acquired on award vesting and delivery at a realized value of $8,521,585. This value includes restricted
stock units for the ERSUP award in 2023 for which restrictions were lapsed in order to satisfy required tax withholding. Also includes
restricted stock units for an inducement award granted in 2021 for which the second half vested on the second anniversary of the grant date.

(2) The non-employee director compensation program, as approved by the Board, consists of the following cash compensation:

     - Non-employee director annual cash compensation—$115,000

     - Lead Director—$50,000[(a)]

     - Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee—$35,000

     - Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee—$27,500

     - Chair of Public Policy and Sustainability Committee—$27,500

     - Chair of Committee on Directors’ Affairs—$20,000[(a)]

     - All other Audit and Finance Committee members—$10,000

     - All other Human Resources and Compensation Committee members—$7,500

     - All other Public Policy and Sustainability Committee members—$7,500

     - All other Committee on Directors’ Affairs members—$5,000

(a) For the period January 2023 to June 2023 the additional cash compensation for the Lead Director and Chair of Committee on Directors’ Affairs
was $45,000 and $15,000 respectively.

Amounts shown include prorated amounts attributable to time served on the board and committee assignments, which may occur during the year.
Amounts shown in the Fees Earned or Paid in Cash column include any amounts that were voluntarily deferred to the Director Deferral Plan, received in
ConocoPhillips common stock, or received in restricted stock units. Mr. Mullins received 100 percent of his cash compensation in restricted stock units
in 2023, and Mr. Niblock received 50 percent of his cash compensation in restricted stock units in 2023, with an aggregate grant date fair value as
shown in the table. All other directors received their cash compensation in cash or deferred such amounts into the Director Deferral Plan.

(3) Amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock awards granted under our non-employee director compensation program. For active
non-employee directors, on January 15, 2023, each received a 2023 annual grant of restricted stock units with an aggregate value of $220,000 based
on the average of the high and low price for our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, on the grant date. These grants are made in whole shares,
with fractional share amounts rounded up, resulting in a grant of shares with a value of $220,050 to each non-employee director who was a director on
January 15, 2023.

(a) The amounts shown are for payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the director for imputed income. These occurred when
a retirement presentation was made to Ms. Devine upon her retirement from the Board. ConocoPhillips has a practice of making gift presentations
to its retiring directors, especially those of long service. The fair value of the retirement presentation was imputed to Ms. Devine’s income. In such
circumstances, if a director is imputed income in accordance with applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips generally will reimburse the director for
the resulting increased tax costs. All such tax reimbursements have been included above, regardless of whether the corresponding perquisite or
personal benefit is required to be reported pursuant to SEC rules and regulations.

(b) The amount shown is the fair value of the retirement presentation and cost for Ms. Devine. ConocoPhillips has a practice of making gift
presentations to its retiring directors, especially those of long service.

(c) The amounts shown are imputed amounts when, following a board meeting, the director was returned to a location other than their point of origin or
their tax home and therefore considered to be a personal accommodation or when, in route to or from a board meeting, a personal accommodation
was made to make more efficient use of a director’s time and travel requirements.

(d) ConocoPhillips maintains a Matching Gift Program under which we match certain gifts by directors to charities and educational institutions,
excluding religious, political, fraternal, or athletic organizations, that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of the
United States or meet similar requirements under the applicable law of other countries. For active directors, the program matches up to $10,000
in each program year. Administration of the program can cause us to pay more than $10,000 in a single fiscal year due to a lag in processing
claims. The amounts shown are for the actual payments by ConocoPhillips in 2023. As indicated above, Mr. Lance and Mr. Leach are eligible for the
Matching Gift Program as employees rather than as directors.

(6) Ms. Devine retired from the Board effective May 16, 2023. The amounts in the table above include her prorated compensation reflecting the portion of
2023 that she served as a director.

(7) Ms. Freeman resigned from the Board effective August 3, 2023. The amounts in the table above include her prorated compensation reflecting the
portion of 2023 that she served as a director.

### Audit and Finance Committee Report

The Audit and Finance Committee (the “Audit Committee”) assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to provide
independent, objective oversight for ConocoPhillips’ financial reporting functions and internal control systems.

The Audit Committee currently consists of six non-employee directors. The Board has determined that each member of
the Audit Committee satisfies the requirements of the NYSE as to independence and financial literacy. The Board has
determined that at least one member, Arjun N. Murti, is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC.

The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in the written charter adopted by the Board and last
amended on October 4, 2019. The charter is available on our website at www.conocophillips.com under “Investors >
_Corporate Governance.”_

**THE AUDIT COMMITTEE’S RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE:**

 - Discussing with management, the independent auditors, and the internal auditor the integrity of ConocoPhillips’
accounting policies, internal controls, financial statements, financial reporting practices, and select financial
matters, including capital structure, complex financial transactions, financial risk management, retirement
plans, and tax planning;

 - Reviewing, and coordinating the review by other committees of, significant corporate risk exposures and steps
management has taken to monitor, control, and report such exposures;

 - Reviewing the qualifications, independence, and performance of our independent auditors and the
qualifications and performance of our internal auditors and chief compliance officer;

 - Reviewing ConocoPhillips’ overall direction and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and internal
policies, including our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct;

  - Assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight of enterprise risk management, particularly with respect to:
(1) market-based risks; (2) financial reporting; (3) effectiveness of information systems and cybersecurity; and
(4) commercial trading;

 - Discussing with management and the Chief Compliance Officer the implementation and effectiveness of our
global compliance and ethics program; and

 - Maintaining open and direct lines of communication with the Board and management, our Compliance and
Ethics Office, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors.

Management is responsible for preparing ConocoPhillips’ financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP, and for developing, maintaining, and evaluating our internal controls over financial
reporting and other control systems. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing
the annual financial statements prepared by management, assessing the internal control over financial reporting, and
expressing an opinion with respect to each.

One of the Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities is to assist the Board in its oversight of the integrity of
ConocoPhillips’ financial statements. The following report summarizes certain of the Audit Committee’s activities in
this regard for 2023.

**Review with Management. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited consolidated**
financial statements included in ConocoPhillips’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023, which included a discussion of the quality — not just the acceptability — of the accounting principles, the
reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of the disclosures. The Audit Committee also discussed
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2023, included in the financial statements.


-----

**Discussions with Internal Audit. The Audit Committee reviewed ConocoPhillips’ internal audit plan and discussed the**
results of internal audit activity throughout the year. ConocoPhillips’ General Auditor met with the Audit Committee at
every in-person meeting in 2023 and was available to meet without management present at each of these meetings.

**Discussions with the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee met throughout the year**
with Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”), ConocoPhillips’ independent registered public accounting firm, including meeting with
EY at each in-person meeting; EY was also available to meet without management present at each of these meetings.
The Audit Committee has discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed by standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from
EY required by PCAOB rules and has discussed with EY its independence from ConocoPhillips. In addition, the Audit
Committee considered the non-audit services EY provides to ConocoPhillips and concluded that EY’s independence has
been maintained.

**Recommendation to the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors. Based on its review and discussions noted above,**
the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in
ConocoPhillips’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

### Item 2: Proposal to Ratify the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP

#### What am I Voting On?

The Audit Committee has appointed EY to serve as ConocoPhillips’ independent registered public accounting firm for
fiscal year 2024. You are voting on a proposal to ratify such appointment.

###### What are the Audit Committee’s responsibilities with respect to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm?

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the
independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit our financial statements and has the authority to
determine whether to retain or terminate the independent auditor.

The Audit Committee reviews the experience and qualifications of the senior members of the independent auditor’s
team and is directly involved in the appointment of the lead audit partner. Neither the lead audit partner nor the
reviewing audit partner performs audit services for ConocoPhillips for more than five consecutive fiscal years. The
Audit Committee is also responsible for determining and approving the audit engagement fees and other compensation
associated with retaining the independent auditor.

The Audit Committee has evaluated the qualifications, independence, and performance of EY and believes that
continuing to retain EY to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of
ConocoPhillips’ stockholders.

###### What services does the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm provide?

Audit services of EY for fiscal year 2023 included an audit of our consolidated financial statements, an audit of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and services related to periodic filings made with the SEC.
Additionally, EY provided certain other services as described below.


-----

###### How much was the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm paid for 2023 and 2022?

EY’s fees for professional services totaled $13.7 million for 2023 and $13.7 million for 2022. EY’s fees for professional
services included the following:

  - **Audit Fees — fees for audit services, which related to the fiscal year consolidated audit, the audit of the**
effectiveness of internal controls, quarterly reviews, registration statements, comfort letters, statutory and
regulatory audits, and related accounting consultations, were $12.7 million for 2023 and $12.1 million for 2022.

  - **Audit-Related Fees — fees for audit-related services, which consisted of audits in connection with benefit plan**
audits, other subsidiary audits, special reports, asset dispositions, and related accounting consultations, were
$0.9 million for 2023 and $1.5 million for 2022.

  - **Tax Fees — fees for tax services, which consisted of tax compliance services and tax planning and advisory**
services, were $0.1 million for 2023 and $0.1 million for 2022.

  - **All Other Fees — fees for other services were negligible in 2023 and 2022.**

The Audit Committee has considered whether the non-audit services provided to ConocoPhillips by EY impaired EY’s
independence and concluded they did not.

###### Who reviews these services and fees?

The Audit Committee has adopted a pre-approval policy that provides guidelines for the audit, audit-related, tax, and
other non-audit services that EY may provide to ConocoPhillips. The policy (1) identifies the guiding principles that
must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that EY’s independence is not impaired;
(2) describes the audit, audit-related, tax, and other services that may be provided and the non-audit services that
are prohibited; and (3) sets forth pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. Under the policy, all services
to be provided by EY must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated authority to
review and approve services to its Chair. Any such approval must be reported to the entire Audit Committee at the next
scheduled Audit Committee meeting.

###### Will a representative of Ernst & Young be present at the meeting?

One or more representatives of EY will be present at the Annual Meeting. The representative(s) will have an opportunity
to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.

###### What vote is required to approve this proposal?

Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote on the
proposal. If the appointment of EY is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment.


-----

### Item 3: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation

#### What am I Voting On?

Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following advisory resolution:

RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of ConocoPhillips’ Named Executive Officers as
described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section and in the tabular disclosures regarding Named
Executive Officer compensation (together with the accompanying narrative disclosures) in this Proxy Statement.

ConocoPhillips is providing stockholders with the opportunity to vote on an advisory resolution, commonly known as
“Say on Pay,” considering approval of the compensation of ConocoPhillips’ Named Executive Officers.

The Human Resources and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for the compensation of our executive
officers, has overseen the development of a compensation program designed to attract, retain, and motivate executives
who enable us to achieve our strategic and financial goals. The “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and the
tabular disclosures regarding Named Executive Officer compensation, together with the accompanying narrative
disclosures, explain the trends in compensation and application of our compensation philosophies and practices for the
years presented.

The Board believes that ConocoPhillips’ executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with
those of our stockholders. Our compensation program is guided by the philosophy that ConocoPhillips’ ability to deliver
on our disciplined, returns-focused strategy is driven by superior individual performance. The Board believes we must
offer competitive compensation to attract and retain experienced, talented, and motivated employees. In addition,
the Board believes employees in leadership roles within the organization are motivated to perform at their highest
levels when performance-based pay constitutes a significant portion of their compensation. The Board believes that
our philosophy and practices have resulted in executive compensation decisions that are aligned with company and
individual performance, are appropriate in value, and have benefited ConocoPhillips and its stockholders.

###### What is the effect of this resolution?

Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Human Resources and Compensation
Committee and the Board will take the outcome of the vote into account when considering future executive
compensation arrangements.

###### What vote is required to approve this proposal?

Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

### Role of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee

#### Authority and Responsibilities

The HRCC is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight for ConocoPhillips’ executive compensation
programs, for developing and overseeing the development of a succession management plan for the CEO and Senior
Officers, and for determining the compensation of our Senior Officers. Our internal guidelines define a Senior Officer
as an employee who is a senior vice president or higher, any executive who reports directly to the CEO, or any other
employee considered an officer under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of December 31, 2023,
ConocoPhillips had 18 active Senior Officers. In addition, the HRCC acts as administrator of the compensation
programs and certain of the benefit plans for Senior Officers and as an avenue of appeal for current and former Senior
Officers disputing compensation or certain benefits. Finally, the HRCC assists the Board in overseeing the integrity
of ConocoPhillips’ executive compensation practices and programs described in the “Compensation Discussion and
_Analysis” beginning on page 66._

A complete listing of the authority and responsibilities of the HRCC is set forth in the written charter adopted by
the Board and last amended on October 9, 2020, which is available on our website at www.conocophillips.com under
_“Investors > Corporate Governance.”_

#### Members

The HRCC currently consists of six members. All members must meet the independence requirements for “nonemployee” directors under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for “independent” directors under the NYSE Listed
Company Manual, and for “outside” directors under the Internal Revenue Code. The members of the HRCC and the
member to be designated as Chair are reviewed and recommended annually by the Committee on Directors’ Affairs to
the full Board.

#### Meetings

The HRCC holds regularly scheduled meetings in association with each regular Board meeting and meets by
teleconference between such meetings as necessary. In 2023, the HRCC had 7 meetings. The HRCC reserves time
at each regularly scheduled meeting to review matters in executive session with no members of management or
management representatives present except as specifically requested by the HRCC. Additionally, the HRCC reviews
and reports annually on the succession-planning process for the CEO and senior management and meets with the Lead
Director at least annually to evaluate the performance of the CEO. More information regarding the HRCC’s activities at
such meetings appears in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 66.

###### The HRCC is committed to a process of continuous improvement in exercising its responsibilities. To that end, the HRCC:

#### Executive Overview

###### 2023 Compensation Program Structure

Each year the HRCC, advised by its independent compensation consultant and informed by feedback from stockholders,
undertakes a rigorous process to establish and review executive compensation. The HRCC believes a substantial
portion of our executive compensation should be equity-based and focused on rewarding long-term performance and
furthermore, that this approach most closely aligns the interests of our top executives with those of our stockholders.

The four primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to provide a target total value for
compensation that is competitive with our peers and attracts and retains the talented executives necessary to manage
a large and complex company like ConocoPhillips. The following chart summarizes the principal components of our
executive compensation program and the performance drivers of each element.

**2023 Element of Pay** **Overview** **Key Benchmarks/Performance Measures**

###### 2023 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE (VCIP) PAYOUT: 130% OF TARGET

The HRCC carefully considered the final results of the metrics and, based on multiple reviews throughout the year,
approved a payout that reflected the degree of difficulty in achieving the results against the aggressive targets that
were established. No individual performance adjustments were made for the NEOs. Following is a summary of the key
items considered and deliberated. For additional details, refer to pages 85 - 91.

###### 2023 Say on Pay Vote Result, Stockholder Engagement, and Board Responsiveness

ConocoPhillips regularly engages in dialogue with stockholders to continue to reinforce our understanding of
stockholder views regarding our compensation programs, and stockholder feedback is considered a fundamental part
of our success. The Board and the HRCC appreciate these valuable discussions and continue to encourage stockholders
to provide feedback about our executive compensation programs as described on page 53 under “Communications with
_the Board of Directors.”_

###### STRONG SAY ON PAY SUPPORT IN 2023

We continue to remain committed to our stockholder engagement as we value our stockholders’ input on our executive
compensation programs. We are pleased with the results of the 2023 say on pay vote, which received support of
stockholders representing more than 93% of our outstanding stock. We remain committed to ongoing dialogue with
stockholders and other stakeholders to obtain their input on key matters and inform our management and Board about
the issues that our stockholders tell us matter most to them.

###### STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN 2023

In line with our commitment to ongoing stockholder engagement, we requested meetings with stockholders
representing more than 50 percent of our outstanding stock and participated in engagement meetings with
stockholders representing over 40 percent of our outstanding stock and approximately 80% of our institutional
investor base. Members of ConocoPhillips’ management from Investor Relations, Executive Compensation, Human
Resources, Legal, and Sustainable Development all participated in stockholder meetings. In addition, our Lead Director,
Robert A. Niblock participated in a stockholder meeting at the request of one of our largest institutional investors.


-----

###### TRACK RECORD OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT RESPONSIVE TO STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK

ConocoPhillips has a track record of continuously seeking to evolve our compensation programs to incorporate
stockholder feedback, market best practices, and performance and retention considerations. We strive to clarify and
simplify our compensation-related disclosures while providing thorough and meaningful details of our process. Below
are highlights of recent changes to our compensation programs:

 - Effective for the 2024 short-term incentive program and PSP, the Financial metric will include both a relative
and absolute measure for Adjusted ROCE to better align payouts with the stockholder experience; payouts will
continue to be determined on a formulaic basis

 - Effective for the 2023 short-term incentive program, we eliminated relative Total Shareholder Return (but
retained in the long-term program) and increased the weighting of our Financial and Operational measures to
further strengthen the link between performance of the company and payouts

 - Effective for the 2023 short-term incentive program, we created a separately weighted measure for “Energy
Transition Milestones” which enhances the link between our climate commitments and our executive
compensation programs

 - Effective in 2023, we increased the CEO’s stock ownership guideline from six to eight times salary

 - Effective for the 2022 short-term incentive program, we eliminated positive individual performance adjustments
for NEOs

 - Effective in 2021, the company eliminated all grandfathered tax gross-up benefits under our Change in Control
Severance Plan[(1)]

 - Effective in 2021, the company strengthened our stock ownership guidelines by no longer counting unvested PSP
target units toward ownership guidelines while maintaining robust guidelines for NEOs; further, the company
does not count unexercised stock options towards ownership guidelines

(1) Executives who became plan participants after the spinoff in 2012 were not eligible for any gross-up payment. The change removes eligibility for any
gross-up payments for executives who were plan participants prior to the spinoff in 2012 and who were previously grandfathered.

###### 2023 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL – SHARE RETENTION UNTIL RETIREMENT

For the 2023 Proxy Statement, the Comptroller of the State of New York submitted a proposal asking stockholders to
vote in favor of requiring NEOs to retain a significant percentage of shares acquired from equity compensation plans
until reaching normal retirement age. After evaluating the proposal, the HRCC determined that increasing the CEO’s
stock ownership guidelines from six to eight times salary achieved the appropriate balance of being consistent with
market practices, which enables us to attract and retain executive talent, and having robust ownership guidelines that
align executive compensation with stockholder interests. During engagements in 2023, stockholders were supportive
of the change made by the HRCC and did not request any additional changes. The proposal failed to receive significant
support in 2023 with less than 23% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted by the Comptroller
of the State of New York.

###### Executing on our Returns-Focused Value Proposition Delivers Strong Financial and Operational Performance

Throughout 2023, ConocoPhillips demonstrated that we can deliver strong financial and operational performance
consistent with our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles while executing
against our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway
demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital to our stockholders, and achieve our net-zero operational
emissions ambitions.

- _We delivered full year total and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 thousand barrels and 1,067 thousand barrels of oil_
_equivalent per day, respectively, while we continued to enhance our portfolio diversity by opportunistically acquiring the_
_remaining 50% working interest in Surmont, reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing our_
_global LNG strategy._

- _We achieved a 17 percent return on capital employed[(1)] and we delivered competitive returns of capital by distributing_
_$11 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion in cash through the ordinary dividend_
_and variable return of cash (“VROC”) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases._

- _We continued to demonstrate our commitment to our net-zero operational emissions ambition by accelerating our GHG_
_emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%[(2)] and we were awarded the Oil & Gas Methane_
_Partnership 2.0 Gold Standard Pathway designation._

We continue to be guided by our SPIRIT Values and remain committed to executing our foundational principles —
focusing on peer-leading distributions, maintaining a strong balance sheet, executing disciplined investment, and
demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance. Supporting these core principles are our strategic cash flow
allocation priorities: (1) invest enough capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend; (2) grow the dividend
annually; (3) maintain ‘A’ credit rating; (4) return greater than 30 percent of cash from operations to stockholders; and
(5) make disciplined investments to enhance returns.

A summary of the many important accomplishments we achieved in 2023 is shown below:

#### Philosophy and Principles of Our Executive Compensation Program

###### OUR GOALS

Our goals are to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees and to maintain high standards of principled
leadership so we can responsibly deliver energy to the world and provide sustainable value for our stakeholders, now
and in the future.

###### OUR PHILOSOPHY — PAY FOR PERFORMANCE

**We believe that:**

 - Our ability to responsibly deliver energy and provide sustainable value is driven by superior individual performance;

 - A company must offer competitive compensation to attract and retain experienced, talented, and
motivated employees;

 - Employees in leadership roles are motivated to perform at their highest levels when performance-based pay is a
significant portion of their compensation; and

 - The use of judgment by the HRCC plays an important role in establishing increasingly challenging corporate
performance criteria to align executive compensation with company performance.

###### OUR STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

**To achieve our goals, we implement our philosophy through the following principles:**

 - Establish target compensation levels that are competitive with the companies that we compete against for
executive talent;

 - Create a strong link between executive pay and successful execution of our strategy;

 - Encourage prudent risk-taking by our executives;

 - Motivate performance using compensation to reward specific individual accomplishments;

 - Retain talented individuals;

 - Maintain flexibility to better respond to the cyclical energy industry; and

 - Integrate all elements of compensation into a comprehensive package that aligns goals, efforts, and results
throughout the organization.

#### Majority of Executive Compensation is Performance Based

Our executive compensation programs align pay with performance that advances our strategic priorities and interests
of stockholders. As shown below, approximately 91 percent of the CEO’s 2023 target pay and approximately 81 percent
of the other NEOs’ 2023 target pay was performance based. Stock-based, long-term incentives make up the largest
portion of performance-based pay.

#### Components of Executive Compensation

The four primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to provide a target total value for
compensation that is competitive with our peers and attracts and retains the talented executives necessary to manage a
large and complex organization such as ConocoPhillips.

###### Base Salary

Base salary is a central component of compensation for all of our salaried employees. Management, with the assistance
of Mercer, its outside compensation consultant, thoroughly examines the scope and complexity of executive jobs
throughout ConocoPhillips and benchmarks the competitive compensation practices for such jobs. As a result of this
work, management has developed a compensation structure that assigns all positions to specific salary grades. For
our executives, the base salary midpoint increases as the salary grade increases, but at a lesser rate than the overall
target incentive compensation percentages increase. The result is a higher percentage of at-risk compensation as an
executive’s salary grade rises.

We set base salaries to be competitive within our compensation reference group and, for certain staff positions, Fortune
_50-150 Industrials, taking into account responsibilities and duties, individual performance, and time in position. See_
_“Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Setting Target Compensation — Compensation Reference Group”_
beginning on page 79 for a discussion of our benchmarking exercise.

###### Performance-Based Pay Programs

 ANNUAL INCENTIVE

All of our employees throughout the world — including our executives — participate in our annual short-term incentive
program, called the Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”). It is our primary vehicle for recognizing company and
individual performance for the prior year. We believe that having an annual “at risk” compensation element gives
employees a financial stake in the achievement of our business objectives and motivates them to achieve those
objectives.

For all employees, the base VCIP award is comprised of corporate performance categories including HSE, Operational,
Financial, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones. The HRCC has discretion to adjust base awards up
or down depending on individual performance, but the final award, inclusive of any adjustments, may not exceed 200
percent of the target. Beginning with the 2022 program, the HRCC eliminated individual performance adjustments in
the short-term incentive program for NEOs.

###### LONG-TERM INCENTIVES

Our primary long-term incentive compensation programs for executives are the Performance Share Program (“PSP”)
and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, which replaced the Stock Option Program effective with equity grants
made in 2018. The HRCC approved replacing stock options with three-year, time-vested restricted stock units under the
Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program in response to stockholder feedback and to be consistent with market trends.
In addition, the HRCC increased the weighting of the long-term incentive award in the form of performance-based
restricted stock units under the PSP from 60 percent to 65 percent and assigned a weight of 35 percent to the
Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in these programs.

###### PERFORMANCE SHARE PROGRAM

The PSP rewards executives based on ConocoPhillips’ performance over a three-year period. Each year, the HRCC
establishes performance metrics for a new three-year performance period. Thus, performance results in any given year
are considered in three overlapping performance periods. We believe the use of a multi-year performance period helps
to focus management on longer-term results. PSP award targets are set in shares at the beginning of the performance
period, and actual cash payouts, based on the HRCC’s evaluation of performance, are calculated using our stock value
after the conclusion of the three-year performance period. Thus, the value of the performance shares is tied to stock
price performance throughout the performance period.

Targets for participants whose salary grades are changed during a performance period are prorated to align incentive
levels with the individual’s changing level of responsibility. Changes in salary not accompanied by a change in salary
grade do not affect the targets. The targets for the CEO are set annually by the HRCC.

The award is calculated on a formulaic basis using a relative TSR metric and a relative Financial metric, with respective
weightings of 60 and 40 percent. At the end of the performance period, the final award may not exceed 200 percent of
the total target award (the initial target award set in restricted stock units, at the beginning of the performance period,
together with any promotional awards and reinvested dividend equivalents during the performance period). The final
award is determined by the HRCC following several detailed reviews of company performance and is based on the
HRCC’s evaluation of ConocoPhillips’ formulaic performance relative to the preestablished metrics (discussed under
_“Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Corporate Performance Criteria” on page 81)._

###### Performance metrics and peers for performance share programs

The performance metrics and peers established by the HRCC for the PSP 21 (2021-2023),
PSP 22 (2022-2024), PSP 23 (2023-2025), and PSP 24 (2024-2026) awards granted in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024
respectively, have been established as follows:

**Metrics** **Performance Peers[(1)]**

PSP 21, PSP 22, & PSP 23 - S&P 500 Total Return Index[(2)] - Exxon Mobil Corporation

- Relative Total Shareholder - APA Corporation - Hess Corporation[(4)]

(1) Each peer is a performance peer for PSP 21, PSP 22, PSP 23, and PSP 24, unless otherwise noted.

(2) For relative TSR metric only.

(3) Performance peer for PSP 24 award only. Diamondback Energy was added to the performance peer group to reflect our significant footprint in the
Permian Basin and due to the anticipated completion of the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources by Exxon Mobil Corporation in 2024.

(4) On October 23, 2023, Chevron Corporation announced a planned acquisition of Hess Corporation. Effective upon the completion of the acquisition only
the combined company (Chevron Corporation) will be retained for any ongoing performance programs.

(5) Performance peer for PSP 21 and PSP 22 awards only.

(6) Performance peer for PSP 23 and PSP 24 awards only. Pioneer Natural Resources was added to the performance peer group to better reflect our
significant footprint in the Permian Basin. On October 11, 2023, Exxon Mobil announced a planned acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. Effective
upon the completion of the acquisition only the combined company (Exxon Mobil) will be retained for any ongoing performance programs.

###### EXECUTIVE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT PROGRAM

Like the PSP, the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program is designed to reward our executives for long-term share
performance and encourage executive retention while incentivizing absolute performance that is aligned with
stockholder interests. The restricted stock units vest three years following the date of grant, which is competitive with
industry peers.

The combination of the PSP and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, along with our Stock Ownership
Guidelines described under “Executive Compensation Governance — Alignment of Interests — Stock Ownership and
_Holding Requirements” on page 95, provides a comprehensive package of long-term incentives for our executives that_
align their interests with stockholders.

###### STOCK OPTION PROGRAM

In response to stockholder feedback and consistent with market trends, the HRCC discontinued the Stock Option
Program effective with equity grants made in 2018 and substituted the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program.
The practice under the Stock Option Program was to set option exercise prices no lower than the fair market value of
ConocoPhillips stock at the time of the grant. Because an option’s value is derived solely from an increase in our stock
price, options only reward recipients if the value of our stock appreciates. All previously granted and unexercised stock
options are vested and exercisable and expire 10 years following the grant date.

###### OFF-CYCLE AWARDS

ConocoPhillips may make awards outside the PSP or the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Currently, off-cycle
awards are generally granted to certain incoming executives for one or more of the following reasons: (1) to induce
an executive to join ConocoPhillips (occasionally replacing compensation the executive will lose by leaving the prior
employer); (2) to induce an executive of an acquired company to remain with ConocoPhillips for a certain period of time
following the acquisition; or (3) to provide a pro rata equity award to an executive who joins ConocoPhillips during an
ongoing performance period in which the executive is ineligible to participate under the standard PSP or Executive
Restricted Stock Unit Program provisions. In these cases, the HRCC has sometimes approved a shorter period for
restrictions on transfers of restricted stock units than those issued under the PSP or Executive Restricted Stock Unit
Program. Any off-cycle awards to Senior Officers must be approved by the HRCC.

#### Process for Determining Executive Compensation

Our executive compensation programs take into account market-based compensation for executive talent; internal pay
equity among our employees; corporate, business unit, and individual results; and the talents, skills, and experience
that each individual executive brings to ConocoPhillips. Our NEOs each serve without an employment agreement.
All compensation for these officers is set by the HRCC as described below.

###### ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

 HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (HRCC)

 - Annually reviews and determines compensation for the CEO and for each of the NEOs.

 - Makes critical decisions on competitive compensation levels, program design, performance targets and associated
peer groups, corporate and individual performance, and appropriate pay adjustments necessary to reflect shortand long-term performance.

 - Considers annual benchmark data provided by the consultants, dialogues with our largest stockholders, and
evaluates four in-depth management reviews of ongoing corporate performance.

 - The HRCC also has sole authority to retain, terminate, and obtain advice and assistance from a compensation
consultant, external legal, accounting, and other advisors and consultants. The HRCC conducts an annual review of
the HRCC’s independent consultant and has discretion to replace the independent consultant. The HRCC approves
in advance all the work to be done by the independent consultant.

###### MANAGEMENT

 - ConocoPhillips’ Human Resources department supports the HRCC in the execution of its responsibilities and
manages the development of the materials for each committee meeting, including market data, individual and
company performance metrics, and compensation recommendations.

 - The CEO considers performance and makes individual recommendations on base salary, annual incentive, and
long-term equity compensation with respect to Senior Officers, including all NEOs other than himself. These
recommendations are reviewed, discussed, modified, and approved, as appropriate, by the HRCC. No member of
the management team, including the CEO, has a role in determining his or her own compensation.

###### COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS

The HRCC retained FW Cook as its independent executive compensation consultant in 2023. Management also
retained Mercer to provide other consulting services. The consultants compile compensation data, conduct analyses,
supplement internal resources for market analysis, and assist in the evaluation of the compensation of the CEO and
Senior Officers.

The HRCC considered whether any conflict of interest exists with either FW Cook or Mercer in light of SEC rules. The
HRCC assessed the following factors relating to each consultant in its evaluation:

 - Other services provided to us by the consultant;

 - Fees paid by us as a percentage of the consulting firm’s total revenue;

 - Policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest;

 - Any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and a
member of the HRCC or executive officers; and

 - Any ConocoPhillips stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement.

Both FW Cook and Mercer provided the HRCC with appropriate assurances addressing such factors. Based on this
information, the HRCC concluded the work of the consultants did not raise any conflict of interest. The HRCC also
took into consideration all factors relevant to FW Cook’s independence from management, including those specified
in Section 303A.05(c) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, and determined that FW Cook is independent and
performs no other services for ConocoPhillips.

ConocoPhillips is prohibited from employing any FW Cook consultant who worked on our account for a period of one
year after that individual leaves the employment of the independent consultant.

###### RISK ASSESSMENT

ConocoPhillips has considered the risks associated with each of its executive broad-based compensation programs
and policies. As part of the analysis, we considered the performance measures we use, as well as the different
types of compensation, varied performance measurement periods, and extended vesting schedules utilized under
each incentive compensation program. As a result of this review, management concluded the risks arising from our
compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips. As
part of the Board’s oversight of ConocoPhillips’ risk management programs, the HRCC conducts a similar review with
the assistance of its independent compensation consultant. The HRCC agrees with management’s conclusion that the
risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
on ConocoPhillips.


-----

###### Setting Target Compensation — Compensation Reference Group

 COMPENSATION REFERENCE GROUP AND METHODOLOGY

The HRCC regularly assesses the market competitiveness of our executive compensation programs based on data
from a compensation reference group. The compensation reference group is currently made up of 11 energy industry
companies and 11 similarly sized general industry companies that are comparable to ConocoPhillips in terms of size,
scope, and compensable factors. The HRCC utilizes a broader reference group that includes non-energy industry
companies for compensation benchmarking given that ConocoPhillips is uniquely positioned as one of the largest
independent E&P companies based on production and reserves. This reference group, inclusive of general industry
companies, provides more statistically robust compensation data from companies with similar compensable factors as
E&P industry consolidation occurs and is responsive to stockholder feedback. Accordingly, in analyzing the appropriate
composition of the reference group that would help inform 2023 target compensation decisions, the HRCC considered
the following criteria:

(1) Companies with which we compete for business opportunities and executive talent;

(2) Companies with significant operations and capital investments, medium- and long-term project investment cycles,
and complex global operations;

(3) Size, including revenues, assets, and market capitalization; and

(4) Industry focus, particularly companies in the energy industry.

The data is used to assess the competitive market value for executive jobs, assess pay practices, validate targets
for pay programs, test the compensation strategy, observe trends, and provide a general competitive foundation for
decision-making.

###### COMPENSATION REFERENCE GROUP

 - 3M Company  - Exxon Mobil Corporation*  - Occidental Petroleum Corporation*

 - APA Corporation*  - General Dynamics Corporation  - Pfizer Inc.

 - Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  - Halliburton Company*  - Phillips 66*

  - Caterpillar Inc.  - Honeywell International Inc.  - RTX Corporation

 - Chevron Corporation*  - Lockheed Martin Corporation  - Schlumberger N.V.*

 - Cummins Inc.  - Marathon Petroleum Corporation*  - Valero Energy Corporation*

 - Devon Energy Corporation*  - Merck & Co., Inc.

 - EOG Resources, Inc.*  - Northrop Grumman Corporation

- Energy industry companies

Mercer gathers and performs an analysis of market data for each NEO, comparing each of their individual components
of compensation, as well as total compensation, to that of the compensation reference group. This competitive analysis
consists of comparing the market data of each of the pay elements and total compensation at the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles of the compensation reference group to compensation for each of our NEOs. Target total compensation for
each NEO is structured to target market competitive pay levels at approximately the 50th percentile in base salary and
short- and long-term incentive opportunities, taking into account roles, responsibilities and duties, experience, individual
performance, and time in position. The HRCC's independent consultant, FW Cook, reviews and independently advises on
the conclusions reached as a result of this benchmarking.


-----

###### CEO 2023 Compensation

In reviewing 2023 target compensation for the CEO, the HRCC considered the median target compensation of the
compensation reference group, which was approximately $18 million with a median tenure of approximately five
years. Based on this review and considering Mr. Lance’s tenure (11 years), overall performance, the performance of
ConocoPhillips, and the relative positioning of target compensation for Mr. Lance as compared to the market median of
the compensation reference group, the HRCC increased Mr. Lance’s 2023 base salary by 3% effective March 1, 2023,
his 2023 short-term incentive target from 160% to 165% and his 2023 long-term incentive target awards by $0.8 million.
The increase to his long-term incentive target had no pension impact.

###### Internal Pay Equity

We believe our compensation structure provides a framework for an equitable compensation ratio among our
executives, with higher targets for jobs involving greater duties and responsibilities. Our compensation program is
designed so that the individual target level rises as salary grade level increases, with the portion of performance-based
compensation rising as a percentage of total target compensation. The HRCC reviews the compensation of Senior
Officers periodically to ensure the equitable compensation of officers with similar levels of responsibilities.

###### Developing Performance Measures

We believe our performance measures appropriately reflect the performance of ConocoPhillips consistent with our
strategy as an independent E&P company. Specifically, the HRCC has approved a balance of metrics, some that
measure performance relative to our peer group, some that measure absolute performance, and some that measure
progress in executing our strategic and energy transition milestones and objectives. We have selected multiple metrics,
as described herein, because we believe no single metric is sufficient to capture the performance we are seeking to
drive. Moreover, reliance on any metric in isolation is unlikely to promote the well-rounded executive performance
necessary to enable us to achieve long-term success. It is for this reason that metrics are assessed in tandem, rather
than each with a separate weighting and threshold. The HRCC reassesses performance metrics periodically to confirm
that they remain appropriate.

###### Setting Increasingly Challenging Targets

Targets for each metric are set in accordance with our rigorous internal budget. The HRCC believes that increasingly
challenging performance metrics best assess ConocoPhillips’ performance relative to its strategy as an independent
E&P company. Increasingly challenging targets can mean year-over-year performance target increases for safety,
efficiency, emissions reduction, unit cost targets, and margins. However, it can also mean the same or lower
performance targets, recognizing a changing commodity price environment. For example, delivering flat production
targets following significant capital and operating cost reductions or establishing production targets below those set in
prior years after significant asset dispositions would be considered “increasingly challenging.” Likewise, setting higher
cost or capital targets above those set in prior years after significant acquisitions or periods of rising inflation would be
considered “increasingly challenging.”


-----

###### Corporate Performance Criteria

Individual NEO payouts are determined based on the payout for corporate performance. We use the compensation
metrics described below, as approved by our HRCC, to determine the corporate performance payout. The compensation
metrics support our Triple Mandate, are consistent with our strategic cash flow allocation priorities, and, therefore, are
aligned with our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. See “Executive Compensation —
_Strategic Alignment” beginning on page 72. The HRCC determines the ultimate payout of our programs based on how_
well ConocoPhillips performs against targets set for each of these metrics. The compensation metrics and how they
align with our strategic priorities and desired outcomes are described in more detail below.

###### VCIP

HSE Operational Financial Strategic Energy
**20%** **30%** **30%** Milestones Transition

**10%** Milestones

**10%**

###### PSP


TSR
**60%**

###### HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL (VCIP ONLY)


Financial
**40%**


Everything we do depends on safely executing our business plans and operating to high standards of HSE stewardship.
We view this as our fundamental license to operate. We have a comprehensive HSE program across our entire company,
which includes criteria for process and personal safety. We include relative Total Recordable Rate and Process Safety
Events in our compensation metrics to reinforce our commitment to be an industry leader in HSE, drive continuous HSE
improvement, and provide accountability for HSE at all levels of the organization, including among our senior leaders.

Total Recordable Rate is a measure of the rate of recordable injury cases in a year. Process Safety Events is a measure
of the control of process hazards in a facility with the potential to impact people, property, or the environment. This
includes the prevention, control, and mitigation of unintentional releases of hazardous material or energy from primary
containment. We invest significant resources and provide focused attention to continually improve our safety culture
and performance across the entire company.

###### OPERATIONAL (VCIP ONLY)

As an E&P company, strong operational performance is essential for delivering on our commitments to stockholders.
Our Operational metrics include absolute targets for Production, Capital, Operating and Overhead Costs, and
Operational Milestones.

Our primary source of revenue and cash flow is the sale of our produced oil and gas. Therefore, we set an annual
Production target, and we measure results against the approved target. Importantly, we tie our annual Production target
to annual targets for Capital, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Operational Milestones. This is designed to ensure
that we do not inadvertently incentivize actions, such as growing at all costs, that are misaligned with our strategic
priorities. Effective capital and operating cost management also helps us achieve a low cost of supply portfolio in
support of our returns-focused strategy. The Operational Milestones and targets are also designed to create alignment
within our workforce around delivering business plans while maintaining discipline.


-----

###### FINANCIAL (VCIP AND PSP)

The Financial metrics in our compensation programs strongly align with our returns-focused strategy, are core to
delivering our value proposition of superior returns through cycles, and strongly correlate to total shareholder returns
(“TSR”) and value creation for stockholders. Adjusted ROCE is an important metric for ensuring ConocoPhillips is
efficiently allocating capital and is a strong indicator of long-term share price performance. We include Adjusted ROCE
in both our VCIP and PSP to ensure that we maintain financial discipline and balance short- and long-term performance.

Our Financial compensation measure includes Adjusted ROCE relative to peers over a one- and three-year period.
Evaluation of our performance relative to peers is designed to provide above or below target payouts based on our
performance against our performance peer group. These relative metrics are measured from third quarter to third
quarter for the relevant periods because full-year peer data is not publicly available at the time of the HRCC annual
performance assessment. Therefore, Adjusted ROCE as used for our Financial compensation metrics will differ from
ROCE as calculated for other periodic reporting.

For VCIP and PSP, the impact of non-operational results and special items that are unusual or nonrecurring are removed
as well as the impact of cash, consistent with ConocoPhillips’ strategy to maintain cash on the balance sheet to ensure
adequate liquidity through down cycles. Adjusted ROCE is calculated as follows:


**earnings plus or minus special items**
**_plus after-tax interest_**
**expense plus minority interest** **÷**


**cash adjusted average capital employed**
**(total equity plus total debt less cash and**
**cash equivalents, restricted cash, and**
**short-term investments)**


###### STRATEGIC MILESTONES (VCIP ONLY)

Delivering on our value proposition requires that we take actions and steward the business in ways that are not
exclusively operational or financial in nature. Our Strategic Milestones represent annual actions to progress our
long-term objectives that position the company to grow and develop over the coming years and decades and
that are aligned to our strategy. These metrics provide a direct link from our stated strategy to metrics in the
compensation programs.

###### ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES (VCIP ONLY)

Effective with our 2023 short-term incentive program, we created a separately weighted measure for “Energy
Transition Milestones.” These milestones are guided by our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and
gas production to meet energy transition demand while delivering competitive returns and focusing on achieving our
net-zero operational emissions ambition. Creating a separate metric serves to further enhance the link between our
climate commitments and our executive compensation programs.

###### RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (PSP ONLY)

We believe our Operational and Financial measures and Strategic and Energy Transition Milestones have a strong,
positive correlation to TSR in our sector. Thus, as we pursue these measures, we expect to achieve superior returns
to stockholders. TSR is the best overall indicator of our long-term success. By integrating compensation metrics
with strategic priorities, we believe we are strongly aligned with stockholder interests across time periods and
through cycles.

We believe it is important to include TSR in our PSP because it is the most tangible, visible measure of the value we
have created for stockholders during the relevant period.

TSR represents the percentage change in stock price from the beginning to the end of a performance period, plus
the percentage impact from common stock dividends paid during the performance period assuming dividends are
reinvested into the stock. Consistent with market practice, we calculate TSR for compensation purposes based on a
20-trading day simple average prior to the beginning of a period and a 20-trading day simple average prior to the end of
the stated period.


-----

We measure TSR relative to our performance peer group to mitigate the influence of sector-wide factors, such as
commodity price volatility, on our stock price.

###### MEASURING PERFORMANCE — PERFORMANCE PEER GROUP

Our performance peer group is used to evaluate relative business results in both our annual incentive and performance
share programs. This includes both relative TSR and relative Adjusted ROCE. The HRCC believes our performance is
best measured against both large independent E&P companies with diverse portfolios and some of the largest publicly
held integrated oil and gas companies that we compete against in our business operations. In addition, the S&P 500
Total Return Index is included in our performance peer group (for the relative TSR metric only) because the HRCC
believes that we should be measured against the companies that we compete with for capital in the broader market. We
believe that our performance peer group is representative of the companies that investors use for relative performance
comparisons. Additionally, the inclusion of the index as a performance peer further aligns executive pay with long-term
stockholder interests as we will be required to outperform both industry peers and a market-based index to receive a
maximum payout.

The following tables show the performance peer groups that were established for evaluating relative metrics for the
periods indicated.

###### PERFORMANCE PEER GROUP FOR 2023 VCIP

#### 2023 Executive Compensation Analysis and Results

The following is a discussion and analysis of the decisions the HRCC made regarding our NEOs in 2023.

###### Base Salary

The HRCC reviews base salary annually for each of the NEOs. The salary adjustment program is determined by annual
benchmarking. Individual salary increases are the result of individual performance, relative position to market, and
changes to salary grade. Base salaries for the CEO and for Messrs. Olds and Macklon and Ms. Rose were increased 3
to 8 percent effective March 1, 2023, based on their performance and competitive positioning relative to their peers
in the compensation reference group. Effective March 1, 2023, the HRCC approved a promotion, including a 5 percent
base salary increase, for Mr. Bullock reflecting the broad scope of his responsibilities, performance, and competitive
positioning relative to peers in the compensation reference group.

The table below shows the annualized base salary for each NEO as of the date shown:

**Name** **12/31/2022** **12/31/2023**

**R.M. Lance** $1,700,000 $1,751,000

**W.L. Bullock, Jr.** 964,776 1,013,016

**K.B. Rose** 924,000 951,984

**N.G. Olds** 787,536 850,560

**D.E. Macklon** 858,528 910,056

###### Performance-Based Programs

Actual awards earned under our performance-based programs can range from zero to 200 percent of the initial
award for our NEOs. In determining performance-based compensation awards for our NEOs for performance periods
concluding at the end of 2023, the HRCC began by assessing overall company performance. To that end, the HRCC
considered the performance reviews throughout and after the performance period ended to assess the degree of
difficulty in achieving absolute performance targets and the extent to which such targets were achieved. The HRCC
then used the percentile-based matrix below to formulaically evaluate the results of the Financial metric (relative
Adjusted ROCE) in the VCIP and PSP and the relative TSR metric in the PSP.

**If between two levels, straight line interpolation is used.**


**Percentile Rank** **Below 25th**


**25th** **50th** **85th or higher**

35% 100% 200%


Payout

-----

###### Annual Incentive — Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP)

All of our employees are eligible for the VCIP. The VCIP payout for our NEOs is calculated using the following formula
with the maximum VCIP payout capped at 200 percent of target. The HRCC has the sole authority to determine the
corporate performance payout based on its assessment of our performance against our metrics. Beginning with the
**2022 VCIP, the HRCC eliminated positive individual performance adjustments for the NEOs, and payouts are solely**
**determined by the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC.**

**Eligible Earnings** **Target Percentage for the Salary Grade** **Corporate Performance Payout**


###### VCIP CORPORATE PERFORMANCE

We incorporate a balance of metrics into our annual incentive program that align with delivering our value
proposition and maintaining competitiveness versus our performance peer group. Our program includes both
line-of-sight and strategic metrics, as well as both absolute and relative metrics. We do not believe that a single
metric is sufficient for driving the behaviors or performance we seek. Therefore, we carefully consider and select
a combination of metrics that best ensures accountability across the organization for both short- and longer-term
business success. The HRCC routinely reviews and reassesses the VCIP performance metrics and confirm that
they remain appropriate for driving desired performance outcomes.

In December 2022, the HRCC approved the five corporate performance measures by which it would judge
corporate performance for the 2023 VCIP payout. The corporate measures and assigned weights were: HSE
(20%); Operations (30%); Financial (30%); Strategic Milestones (10%); and Energy Transition Milestones (10%).

The HRCC determines the ultimate payout of our programs based on the extent to which ConocoPhillips achieves
the targets established under the five corporate performance measures set forth above. These measures
support our Triple Mandate and directly correspond to our strategic cash flow allocation priorities, which
support our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. See “Executive Compensation —
_Strategic Alignment” on page 72 and “Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Corporate Performance_
_Criteria” beginning on page 81._


-----

###### SETTING TARGETS FOR 2023

The HRCC reviews and approves targets for the performance metrics annually. The process begins with our
rigorous internal budget, which is set each year across the organization and then approved by our Board.
For setting VCIP targets, the outputs from the internal budget are reviewed for alignment with the value
proposition, as well as degree of difficulty. The HRCC believes that targets should reflect a reasonable chance of
achievability, but also be challenging. Significant effort is invested to ensure that the metrics and targets reflect
both a desire for continuous improvement and a realistic assessment of changes in the market environment and
our portfolio.

For the relative Financial metric, the HRCC established a matrix to inform payout decisions, see page 84. In the
case of HSE, Operations, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones metrics, the HRCC relies on a
rigorous and transparent review process with management and exercises its judgment based on its knowledge
of the business to assess degree of difficulty and determine the appropriate payout (see “HRCC Review Process”
beginning on page 88). The HRCC does not believe either a matrix or a threshold-maximum approach is
appropriate for all metrics given the significant volatility of the business in any given year and the influence of
non-operated activities over which ConocoPhillips has limited control. Having a threshold-maximum approach
could incentivize behaviors that are counter to the best interest of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders. Based
on our 2023 outreach, we believe the majority of stockholders were satisfied with the level of disclosure around
our process, and we have continued to enhance transparency around our targets and results and have sought to
continuously improve our disclosures around payout decisions.

Absolute VCIP targets for 2023 were aligned with the production, capital, and operating and overhead external
guidance ConocoPhillips provided externally. See “HRCC Annual Compensation Cycle” on page 78.

The HSE, Operations, Financial, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones targets set by the HRCC
are as follows:

###### HSE

We target top-quartile performance relative to our peers for Total Recordable Rate and absolute continuous
improvement for TRR and for Process Safety Events. We target being an industry leader in HSE in an effort
to drive continuous HSE improvement and provide accountability for HSE at all levels of the organization,
including among our senior leaders.

###### OPERATIONS

**Production**

The target was set at 1,790 MBOED, which was aligned with the guidance provided to the marketplace
in 2023. The HRCC considered the target to be increasingly challenging. On an adjusted basis, the
Production target represented 3 percent organic growth as compared to 2022 pro forma production of
1,730 MBOED. The HRCC also considered the target to be increasingly challenging when balanced with
the Operating and Overhead Costs target and Capital target.

**Capital**

The target was set at $11.2 billion, which was consistent with the operating plan outlined to the
marketplace in 2023. The Capital target was an increase of approximately 11 percent from full-year
2022 capital expenditures, due to increased spend on longer-cycle projects, including PALNG, Willow,
NFE and NFS, more than offsetting the absence of 2022 acquisition spend.


-----

**Operating and Overhead Costs**

The target was set at $8.2 billion, which was consistent with the operating plan outlined to the
marketplace in 2023. The Operating and Overhead target was an increase of approximately 6 percent
from the full year 2022 operating and overhead expenditures due to volume growth and inflation.

**Operational Milestones**

In the Lower 48, milestones included delivering on Big 3 unconventional development programs as
well as progressing optimization efforts across the basins. In Canada, milestones included transitioning
Montney to early development by achieving flowback on Pad 5 and Pad 6, as well as starting up
the second phase of the company’s gas processing facility. Additionally in Canada, milestones for
Surmont included achieving first steam on Pad 267. In Alaska, milestones included reaching FID on
Willow, subject to regulatory and legal resolutions, and advancing Nuna 3T to AFE approval. In Norway,
milestones included mechanically completing the first subsea template and facilities on Tommeliten
A. In Malaysia, milestones included advancing WL4-00 toward AFF decision and finalizing a strategic
path forward. In China, milestones included achieving Bohai Phase 4B first oil and sanctioning Bohai
Windfarm AFE, subject to government approval.

The exploration milestones included executing the Bear-1 exploration well in Alaska. Additionally, we
included a corporate technology milestone to deliver the first release of nxtgenERP with no loss of
business effectiveness or integrity.

###### FINANCIAL

Our financial performance is measured according to our relative performance of Adjusted ROCE among
our peers.

###### STRATEGIC MILESTONES

Our Strategic milestones included:

 - Progressing the LNG business through advancing new PALNG, NFE, and NFS projects, securing several
regasification and offtake agreements, and building out our LNG organization;

 - Implementing action plans for priority E&S risks and tracking progress against mitigations; and

 - Refreshing our DEI strategy globally and identifying how to assess progress on each component of
diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The HRCC believes these targets, which aligned with external guidance provided to the marketplace, were
appropriate and challenging and consistent with ConocoPhillips’ disciplined, returns-focused strategy.

###### ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES

Our Energy Transition Milestones included:

 - Demonstrating progress against our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition;

 - Achieving an annual GHG emissions intensity aligned with our 2030 target trajectory range[(1)], including
any updates to the 2030 target;

 - Executing our capital and cost budget for approved MACC projects; and

 - Advancing multiple low carbon opportunities.


(1) In 2023, we increased our target trajectory range from 40-50% to 50-60% gross operated emissions intensity reduction, using a 2016 baseline.


-----

###### HRCC REVIEW PROCESS

After meeting to approve the metrics (as discussed above), the HRCC met four more times with management
to review progress and performance against the approved metrics to determine award payouts under the
VCIP. The first and second reviews occurred during 2023 and were designed to provide the HRCC with
information concerning the ongoing performance of ConocoPhillips. The third review with the HRCC in late
January 2024 focused on the detailed final results for each performance metric relative to the targets, a degree
of difficulty discussion, and an explanation of normalization adjustments when appropriate. The final review
in mid-February 2024 focused on a summary of the results for each performance metric and deliberation and
determination of the final payout by the HRCC. This process allows the HRCC to consider results, degree of
difficulty, and normalization adjustments in one meeting and make informed payout decisions in a separate
meeting. Results for Production, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Capital, as applicable, are normalized to
account for acquisitions and dispositions (e.g., dispositions of non-strategic assets in the Lower 48), foreign
exchange rates, commodity price-related adjustments of actuals to targets and related tax and productionsharing contract impacts, and items beyond the control of management (e.g., production impacts from natural
disasters). This allows the HRCC to measure results against targets on a consistent basis and measure
management performance so there is no benefit or detriment to executive compensation for these items. The
normalization adjustments are reviewed by and discussed with the HRCC. The HRCC retains the discretion to
make a positive or negative adjustment to awards based on its determination of appropriate payouts. Beginning
with the 2022 VCIP, the HRCC eliminated positive individual adjustments for the NEOs, and payouts are solely
determined by the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC.

###### 2023 RESULTS

 HSE (ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE) – 20% weighting

2023 was a challenging year for HSE. Although we had several successes, there were also opportunities for
improvement. We remained in the top quartile among our peers for TRR, and we experienced fewer process
safety events as compared to 2022. We also experienced zero spills greater than 100 barrels. Although we
remained an industry leader among our peers, we had an increase in serious incidents, including one fatality.
This serves as a reminder to keep focusing on surpassing the bar that we continuously raise. The HRCC
believes that the resulting 85% payout reflects ConocoPhillips’ overall HSE performance.

###### OPERATIONS (ABSOLUTE) – 30% weighting

Our operations performance resulted in adjusted Production of 1,813 MBOED, 1 percent above our target of
1,790 MBOED. Production performance was strong across our portfolio, driven by Lower 48 well performance
and accelerated timing. Our Capital spending of $11.1 billion, adjusted for approved scope changes, came in
1 percent below our 2023 VCIP target of $11.2 billion. Our Operating and Overhead Costs came in 4 percent
above the $8.2 billion target, reaching $8.6 billion, due to higher non-operated workover activity, higher
volumes and commodity–driven inflation. We also achieved or exceeded all of our Operational Milestones
(see “Operational Milestones” on page 87) with the exception of the nxtgenERP milestone, where we made
the decision to delay releases to complete additional testing to address potential impacts to business
effectiveness. In considering the results of these interdependent operations metrics collectively, the degree
of difficulty, and the company’s strong execution of operating plans, the HRCC determined a slightly abovetarget payout (125%) was warranted.


-----

###### FINANCIAL (RELATIVE) – 30% weighting

Our Adjusted ROCE relative to peers was in the 58th percentile, which was driven by our operational
performance and success across our global portfolio. The HRCC followed the matrix on page 84 to determine
the payout (122%).

###### STRATEGIC MILESTONES (ABSOLUTE) – 10% weighting

We far exceeded expectations on all of the Strategic Milestones. We significantly progressed the LNG
business through advancing new PALNG, NFE and NFS projects, secured regasification and offtake
agreements and staffed key roles. We identified and implemented action plans for risk mitigations. We
remained focused on DEI, completing the development of educational DEI materials, and leveraging DEI
_Perspectives survey data to refresh our DEI strategy. In addition, we identified how to assess progress on_
each component of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The HRCC determined a maximum payout (200%) was
warranted given ConocoPhillips’ exceptional performance in achieving the Strategic Milestones.

###### ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES (ABSOLUTE) – 10% weighting

We successfully demonstrated meaningful progress against our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition,
including by increasing our target trajectory range for 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60% of gross operated
emissions intensity reduction using a 2016 baseline. We also achieved an annual GHG emissions intensity
aligned with our 2030 target trajectory range. In addition, we completed our approved MACC projects
within the allotted capital and cost budget. We also advanced multiple low carbon opportunities. The HRCC
determined that an above target payout (190%) was appropriate considering our demonstrated commitment
to progressing towards our energy transition goals.

These results reflect a strong year for ConocoPhillips. We achieved or exceeded our target for almost every
metric and showed our commitment and ability to deliver strong financial and operational performance
across our global portfolio. The HRCC believes that the resulting 130% corporate performance payout
reflects ConocoPhillips’ overall strong performance in 2023.

(1) Operating and overhead costs include production and operating expenses; selling, general, and administrative expenses; and controllable exploration
general and administrative expenses, geological and geophysical, and lease rental and other expenses, adjusted to remove the impact of special
items that are unusual or nonrecurring. Operating and Overhead Costs results and the absolute metric results for Capital are adjusted to normalize, as
applicable, for acquisitions and dispositions, foreign exchange rates, price, and related tax and production-sharing contract impacts, and items beyond
the control of management. Actual operating and overhead costs and capital for 2023 were $8.6B and $11.2B, respectively.

(2) For relative metrics, adjustments for material, nonrecurring special items (e.g., gains on dispositions, impairments) are made to company results to
determine Adjusted ROCE, and we also use disclosed material adjustments made by peers when measuring relative results for these metrics. Adjusted
earnings (loss) that are part of the Adjusted ROCE calculations is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to GAAP and a discussion of the
usefulness and purpose of adjusted earnings (loss) can be found in Appendix A.

(3) Using a 2016 baseline.

###### VCIP Payouts for the NEOs

The calculation of the 2023 VCIP award for each NEO is summarized below. The HRCC eliminated individual positive
performance adjustments for the NEOs effective with the 2022 VCIP, so the payout below solely reflects the corporate
performance payout approved by the HRCC.

**2023 Eligible** **Corporate**
**Name** **Earnings** **Target VCIP** **Payout** **Total Payout**
**R.M. Lance** $1,742,500 165% 130% 3,737,663
**W.L. Bullock, Jr.** 1,004,976 113%[(1)] 130% 1,469,777

**D.E. Macklon** 901,468 95% 130% 1,113,313

(1) Effective March 1, 2023, Mr. Bullock was promoted and his target VCIP percentage increased from 100% to 115%; the prorated VCIP percentage is
shown in the table above.

###### Long-Term Incentive: Performance Share Program (PSP)

The PSP is designed to motivate senior leadership worldwide to execute their duties in a way that not only achieves
ConocoPhillips’ approved strategy but also closely aligns senior leadership with long-term stockholder interests.
Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in the PSP. Grants made to NEOs in 2023 for PSP 23 are
summarized in note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. Performance measures and peers for all ongoing
programs can be found on page 76.


###### PSP 21 PERFORMANCE

In 2021, the HRCC approved performance metrics for the PSP performance period running from January 2021
through December 2023. The PSP uses staggered three-year performance periods, with PSP 21 using two
corporate performance measures: (1) relative Total Shareholder Return, which is weighted 60%; and (2) relative
Financial, which is weighted 40%.

The HRCC considered ConocoPhillips’ overall performance based on the PSP 21 performance measures set
forth above, which, similar to VCIP, directly correspond to our strategic priorities and support our goal to deliver
superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. See “Executive Overview — Executive Compensation —
_Strategic Alignment” on page 72 and “Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Corporate Performance_
_Criteria” beginning on page 81._

###### HRCC REVIEW PROCESS

In determining award payouts under PSP 21, the HRCC met several times with management throughout the
performance period to review progress and performance against the approved metrics. The review with the
HRCC in late January 2024 focused on the detailed final results for each performance metric. The final review
in mid-February 2024 focused on a summary of the results for each performance metric and deliberation and
determination of the final payout by the HRCC. This process allows the HRCC to consider results in one meeting
and make informed payout decisions in a separate meeting.

###### 2021 – 2023 RESULTS

**TSR – 60% weighting**

Three-year TSR of 46% resulted in a relative ranking of 4th in TSR, putting us in the 71st percentile
(160% payout per the matrix) in TSR compared to our performance peer group based over the three-year
performance period on the 20-day average methodology, outperforming the independent and integrated
performance peer average and the overall peer average, including significantly outperforming the S&P 500.
The HRCC then followed the matrix on page 84 in making its determination of the payout for this relative
TSR metric.

**FINANCIAL – 40% weighting**

We finished 4th in Adjusted ROCE (63rd percentile) relative to our performance peers over the three-year
performance period (137% payout per the matrix). The HRCC followed the matrix on page 84 in making its
determination of the payout for the relative Financial metric.

The HRCC believes ConocoPhillips is executing the right strategy and recognizes the leadership and
commitment our executives demonstrated during the performance period. The HRCC believes that a 151%
**formulaic payout reflects ConocoPhillips’ overall strong performance during the 2021-2023 performance period.**


-----

The HRCC believes there is strong alignment between stockholder interests and executive compensation. The following
table describes the details the HRCC considered as quantitative performance measures and summarizes the payout
decisions for PSP 21:

ROCE, and we also use disclosed material adjustments made by peers when measuring relative to peer performance. Adjusted earnings (loss) in the
absolute Adjusted ROCE calculations is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation to GAAP and a discussion of the usefulness and purpose of
adjusted earnings (loss) can be found in Appendix A.

###### Long-Term Incentive: Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program

All 2023 awards under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program were made at target. Approximately 60 of our
current employees participate in this program. The 2023 grants to NEOs can be found in note 3 of the Summary
_Compensation Table on page 98._

#### Other Executive Compensation and Benefits

###### Other Compensation and Personal Benefits

In addition to our four primary compensation components, we provide our NEOs a limited number of benefits as
described below. Some benefits, such as executive life insurance coverage and nonqualified benefit plans, are provided
for competitive reasons. Other benefits are designed primarily to promote a healthy work/life balance, to provide
opportunities for developing business relationships, and to personalize our social responsibility programs.

**Comprehensive Security Program — Because our executives face personal safety risks in their roles as representatives**
of a global E&P company, our Board has adopted a comprehensive security program for our executives.

**Personal Entertainment — ConocoPhillips executives participate in community, university, and philanthropic**
organizations at the request of the company. We also purchase tickets to various cultural, charitable, civic,
entertainment, and sporting events for business development and relationship-building purposes, as well as to maintain
our involvement in communities where we operate. Occasionally, our employees, including our executives, make
personal use of tickets that would not otherwise be used for business purposes. We believe these tickets offer an
opportunity to expand our networks at a very low or no incremental cost to ConocoPhillips.

**Tax Gross-Ups — Certain of the personal benefits received by our executives are deemed by the Internal Revenue**
Service to be taxable income to the individual. When we determine that such income is incurred for purposes more
properly characterized as company business than personal benefit, we provide additional payments to the executive
to reimburse the cost of including the item in the executive’s taxable income. Most often, these tax gross-up payments
are provided for travel by a family member or other personal guest to attend a meeting or function at our request in
furtherance of company business, such as Board meetings, company-sponsored events, and industry and association
meetings where spouses or other guests are expected to attend.


-----

**Tax and Financial Planning Services — We provide our NEOs with certain tax, estate, and financial planning services**
up to $15,000 plus any travel–related expenses incurred by the advisor when meeting with an executive. The benefit
is provided while serving as an executive and for up to six months following retirement from the company. We do not
provide a tax gross-up for these benefits.

**Executive Life Insurance — We provide life insurance policies and death benefits for all of our U.S.-based salaried**
employees (at no cost to the employee) with a face value approximately equal to the employee’s annual salary. For each
of our executives under the ConocoPhillips benefits program, we maintain an additional life insurance policy (at no cost
to the executive) with a value approximately equal to the executive’s annual salary. In addition to these two plans, we
also provide our executives the option of purchasing group variable universal life insurance or term life insurance in
an amount up to eight times their respective annual salaries. We believe that making additional insurance available for
purchase at their own expense is valued by our executives and can be provided at no cost to ConocoPhillips.

**Defined Contribution Plans — In addition to the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan, which is our qualified defined contribution**
plan for U.S.-based employees, we maintain the nonqualified defined contribution plans listed below for our executives.
These plans allow deferred amounts to grow tax-free until distributed, while enabling ConocoPhillips to use the money
for the duration of the deferral period for general corporate purposes. These types of plans are common among our
competitors, and we believe the lack of such plans would put ConocoPhillips at a disadvantage in attracting and
retaining talented executives.

- Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans — The purpose of our voluntary nonqualified deferred compensation plans
is to allow executives to defer a portion of their salary and incentive compensation so that such amounts are not
immediately taxable.

- Make-Up Plans — The purpose of our nonqualified defined contribution make-up plans is to provide benefits that an
executive would otherwise lose due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on high-income participants
in qualified plans.

Additional information on these plans is provided under Nonqualified Deferred Compensation beginning on page 107.

**Defined Benefit Plans — In addition to the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan, which is our qualified defined benefit plan**
for U.S.-based employees, we also maintain nonqualified defined benefit plans for our executives. The primary purpose
of these plans is to provide benefits that an executive would otherwise lose due to limitations imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code on high-income participants in qualified plans. The U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan available
to our NEOs is the Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (“KESRP”). This type of plan is common among our
competitors and we believe the lack of such a plan would put ConocoPhillips at a disadvantage in attracting and
retaining talented executives. Effective January 1, 2019, the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan was closed to new hires
and rehires who will instead receive an enhanced benefit under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and a related make-up
plan. Additional information on the KESRP is provided under Pension Benefits beginning on page 105.

###### Severance Plans and Changes in Control

We maintain plans to address severance of our executives in certain circumstances as described under Executive
_Severance and Changes in Control beginning on page 109. Plans of this nature are common within the industry. Our plans_
are designed to aid ConocoPhillips in attracting and retaining executives. Under each of our severance and change
in control severance plans, the executive must terminate from service with ConocoPhillips to receive severance pay.
Excise tax gross-up benefits are not available under these plans.

Vesting of awards under the PSP, Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, and Stock Option Program that are
assumed by an acquirer will accelerate only upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a qualifying
termination of employment of the employee (usually called a “double trigger”).

###### Broadly Available Plans

Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the same basic benefits package as our other U.S. salaried employees. This
includes expatriate benefits; relocation services; medical, dental, vision, life, and accident plans; health savings
accounts; and flexible spending arrangements for health care and dependent care expenses.


-----

#### Executive Compensation Governance

###### Alignment of Interests — Stock Ownership and Holding Requirements

We place a premium on aligning the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. All executives are
subject to stock ownership guidelines, with an eight times base salary guideline for the CEO (increased from six times
effective in 2023) and three to four times base salary guideline for other NEOs. Executives have five years from the date
they become subject to the Stock Ownership Guidelines to comply. Holdings counted toward the guidelines include:
(1) shares of stock owned individually, jointly, or in trusts controlled by the employee; (2) restricted stock and restricted
stock units; (3) shares owned in qualified savings or stock ownership plans, whether vested or not; and (4) stock or
units in nonqualified deferred compensation plans, whether vested or not. Holdings not counted toward the guidelines
include PSP target units and unexercised stock options. Employees subject to the guidelines who have not reached
the required level of stock ownership are expected to hold shares received upon vesting or earn-out of restricted
stock, restricted stock units (net of shares for taxes), and shares received upon exercise of stock options (net of shares
tendered or withheld for payment of exercise price and shares for taxes), so they meet their requirement in a timely
manner. The multiple of equity held by each of our NEOs currently exceeds our established guidelines.

###### Clawback Policy

The HRCC has approved a Clawback Policy providing that ConocoPhillips will recoup any incentive compensation
(cash or equity) paid or payable to any executive to the extent such recoupment is required or contemplated by the
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the SarbanesOxley Act, or any other applicable law or listing standards. To comply with NYSE listing standards and final SEC rules
under the Dodd-Frank Act, the HRCC adopted a restated Clawback Policy effective October 2, 2023. The Clawback
Policy requires the Board to recoup incentive compensation (cash or equity) paid in the event of certain business
circumstances, including a financial restatement. The policy operates in addition to provisions already contained in
our award documents for the PSP, the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, the Stock Option Program, and other
compensation programs using company equity. Those documents permit the HRCC or other granting committee to
suspend rights to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of awards already requested, or cancel awards granted if an
executive engages in any activity we determine is detrimental to ConocoPhillips, including acts of misconduct (such as
embezzlement, fraud, theft, or disclosure of confidential information) or other acts that harm our business, reputation, or
employees, as well as misconduct that results in ConocoPhillips having to prepare an accounting restatement. To date,
no NEOs have been subject to any clawbacks.

###### Anti-Pledging and Anti-Hedging

Pursuant to our insider trading policy, ConocoPhillips directors, officers and all other employees are prohibited from
pledging company stock, holding company stock in a margin account, or entering into hedging transactions, including
the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. This
policy, together with the Stock Ownership Guidelines discussed above, helps ensure that our NEOs and other Senior
Officers remain subject to the risks, as well as the rewards, of stock ownership.

###### Equity Grant Practices

When the HRCC awards Performance Share Units, Executive Restricted Stock Units, or other equity grants to the NEOs,
the fair market value of the units or the exercise price of the options or other equity is determined based on an average
of the stock’s high and low prices on the date of grant (or the preceding business day, if the markets are closed on the
date of grant). For purposes of granting such awards, we use an average of the closing prices on the 10 trading days
preceding the date of grant. Grants of Performance Share Units and Executive Restricted Stock Units are generally
made at the HRCC’s February meeting (the date of which is determined at least a year in advance) or, in the case of new
hires, on the date of commencement of employment or the date of HRCC approval, whichever is later.


-----

###### Statutory and Regulatory Considerations

In designing, implementing, and determining compensation under our compensation programs, we act in accordance
with our compensation philosophy and believe that attracting, retaining, and motivating our employees with
compensation programs that support long-term value creation is in the best interests of our stockholders. However, we
also take into account the various tax, accounting, and disclosure rules associated with various forms of compensation.
We have reviewed and considered the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code and designed deferred compensation programs with the intent that they comply with or are exempt from
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. We generally seek to preserve tax deductions for executive compensation
where possible and commensurate with our practice of aligning pay with performance. Nonetheless, ConocoPhillips has
awarded compensation that is not fully tax deductible when the HRCC believes that doing so is in the best interest of
our stockholders, and ConocoPhillips reserves the right to do so in the future.

### Human Resources and Compensation Committee Report

**Review with Management. The HRCC has reviewed and discussed the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis”**
presented in this Proxy Statement with members of management.

**Discussion with Independent Executive Compensation Consultant. The HRCC has discussed with FW Cook, an**
independent executive compensation consulting firm, ConocoPhillips’ executive compensation programs, as well as
specific compensation decisions made by the HRCC. FW Cook was retained directly by the HRCC, independent of
management. The HRCC has received written disclosures from FW Cook confirming no other work has been performed
for ConocoPhillips by FW Cook, has discussed with FW Cook its independence from ConocoPhillips, and believes FW
Cook to have been independent of management.

**Recommendation to the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors. Based on its review and discussions noted above, the**

### Executive Compensation Tables

The following tables and accompanying narrative disclosures provide information concerning total compensation paid
to the Chief Executive Officer and the other NEOs of ConocoPhillips for 2023. Please also see our discussion of the
relationship between the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” to these tables under “2023 Executive Compensation
_Analysis and Results” beginning on page 84. The data presented in the tables that follow include amounts paid to the_
NEOs by ConocoPhillips or any of its subsidiaries for 2023.

#### Summary Compensation Table

The Summary Compensation Table below reflects amounts earned with respect to 2023 and, with regard to non-equity
incentive plan compensation, for the performance period ending in 2023. The table does not include the cost of benefits
that are generally available to our U.S.-based salaried employees, such as our medical, dental, vision, life, and accident
plans, disability, and health savings accounts and flexible spending account arrangements for health care and dependent
care expenses. All of our NEOs are U.S.-based salaried employees.

(1) Includes any amounts that were voluntarily deferred under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan (“KEDCP”).

(2) Our primary short-term incentive compensation arrangement for employees (the Variable Cash Incentive Program or “VCIP”) has performance measures
established by the HRCC and communicated to employees, including the NEOs, at a time when the outcome of the performance is substantially uncertain
for the 2023 performance period. The HRCC must determine the level of achievement under such performance measures before there is any payout to
NEOs. Because of this process, amounts paid under the VCIP are shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the table, rather than the
Bonus column.

(3) Amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made during each of the years indicated under the Performance Share
Program (“PSP”) and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.
See the “Employee Benefit Plans” section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form
10-K for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in this determination. For the awards granted for PSP 23 and 2023 Executive RSUs, the grant
date fair value was $112.50, but as noted in the Equity Grant Practices outlined on page 95 awards are granted using the average of the closing prices
on the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant ($112.658). The difference between these values can increase or decrease the reported amounts
from year to year even if target compensation does not change. A detailed breakdown of 2023 awards in the Stock Awards column of the Summary
_Compensation Table is on the following page:_


-----

###### GRANTS MADE IN 2023

**R.M. Lance** 85,754 $9,647,325 46,176 $5,194,800 $14,842,125

**W.L. Bullock, Jr.** 34,834 3,826,360 11,690 1,315,125 5,141,485

**K.B. Rose** 19,352 2,177,100 9,474 1,065,825 3,242,925

**D.E. Macklon** 16,346 1,838,925 8,802 990,225 2,829,150

The amounts shown for awards from the PSP relate to the respective three-year performance periods that began in each of the years presented.
Performance periods under the PSP generally are three years. As a new performance period has begun each year since the program commenced,
there are three overlapping performance periods ongoing at any time.

The amounts shown for 2021 include the full initial target for PSP 21 for the January 2021–December 2023 performance period, as well as any
incremental targets set during 2021 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. Bullock and Mr. Macklon were
promoted in 2021). The amounts shown for 2022 include the full initial target for PSP 22 for the January 2022–December 2024 performance period,
as well as any incremental targets set during 2022 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. Olds was promoted in
2022). The amounts shown for 2023 include the full initial target for PSP 23 for the January 2023–December 2025 performance period, as well as any
incremental targets set during 2023 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. Bullock was promoted in 2023).

Amounts are shown at target for each year because it is most probable at the setting of the target for the applicable performance periods that targets
will be achieved. If payout was made at maximum levels for company performance the amounts shown would double from the targets shown, although
the value of the actual payout would be dependent upon the stock price and accrued dividend equivalent units at the time of the payout. If payout was
made at minimum levels, the amounts would be reduced to zero. No adjustment is made to the target shown for prior years based upon any change in
probability after the target is set. Changes to targets resulting from promotion or demotion of a NEO are shown as awards in the year of the promotion
or demotion, even though the awards may relate to a program period that began in an earlier year.

The grant date fair values of the target awards for PSP 21 (January 2021-December 2023) granted in 2021 appear in the table in 2021, and any incremental
target awards as a result of a promotion appear in the year in which they were granted. Actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 were
approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting. Pursuant to that approval, payouts were made in February 2024 (with values shown at fair market
value on the date of settlement) to the NEOs as follows: Mr. Lance, 339,301 units valued at $37,453,741; Mr. Bullock, 106,856 units valued at $11,795,300;
Ms. Rose, 73,017 units valued at $8,059,982; Mr. Olds, 65,048 units valued at $7,180,323 ; and Mr. Macklon, 75,201 units valued at $8,301,062. These
amounts do not appear in the Summary Compensation Table. Under the terms and conditions of the awards, participants were able to make elections
prior to the beginning of the performance period to defer all or a portion of the award value into the KEDCP. See the section on Nonqualified Deferred
_Compensation_ beginning on page 107 for further information.

For PSPs beginning in 2012 and later settlement will be made in cash rather than unrestricted shares. For target awards for program periods beginning
in 2013 and later, the vesting period ends shortly after the end of the performance period, except that in the cases of termination due to death, layoff,
or retirement, or after disability or a change in control, the vesting period ends upon the occurrence of the exceptional termination event although
the timing of settlement remains unchanged. For programs beginning prior to 2013, the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the
performance period, to defer the lapsing of restrictions until after separation. For PSPs beginning in 2013 and later, the employee may elect, prior to
the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement value deferred into the KEDCP.

(4) Includes amounts paid under the VCIP and VCIP amounts that were voluntarily deferred to the KEDCP. See the section on Nonqualified Deferred
_Compensation beginning on page 107 for further information. See also note 2 on the previous page._

(5) Amounts represent the actuarial increase in the present value of the NEO’s benefits under all pension plans maintained by ConocoPhillips determined
using interest rate, discount rate, and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in ConocoPhillips’ financial statements. Primarily as a
result of such actuarial factors, the present value of the benefit to Mr. Lance decreased from 2022 to 2023 by $287,376. In accordance with the SEC
rules that do not permit the inclusion of values less than $0 for this column, an amount of zero is shown on the previous page.

_Interest Rates and Discount Rates —_

Interest rate assumption changes have a significant impact on the pension values, with periods of higher interest rates having the effect of decreasing
the actuarial values reported and vice versa. The discount rate assumptions and discount periods from the assumed retirement age to current age used
in determining the present value may also have an impact on the pension values, with higher discount rates having the effect of decreased actuarial
values reported and vice versa, and shorter discount periods having the effect of increased actuarial values reported and vice versa.


-----

_Final Average Pay and Service Credit —_

The years of service credited and increases to compensation are also factors in the benefit accrual. Each additional year of service credit and pay
increases will generally result in an increase in the actuarial values reported. This only applies to Messrs. Lance, Bullock, and Olds who are the only
NEOs who participate in a final average earnings title of ConocoPhillips’ U.S. pension plans. See Pension Benefits beginning on page 105 of this Proxy
Statement for further information.

(6) As discussed in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement, ConocoPhillips provides its executives with a
number of compensation and benefit arrangements. The table below reflects amounts earned in 2023 under those arrangements. We have excluded
the cost of benefits that are generally available to our U.S.-based salaried employees, such as our medical, dental, vision, life, and accident plans,
disability, and health savings and flexible spending account arrangements. All of our NEOs are U.S.-based salaried employees. All Other Compensation
includes the following amounts, which were determined using actual cost paid by ConocoPhillips unless otherwise noted:

(a) ConocoPhillips’ Comprehensive Security Program requires that the CEO, Mr. Lance, fly on company aircraft unless the Global Security Department
determines that other arrangements represent an acceptable risk. All other NEOs are permitted to use the aircraft for preapproved personal travel.
Amounts represent the approximate aggregate incremental cost to ConocoPhillips for personal use of the aircraft, including travel for any family
member or personal guest. Approximate aggregate incremental cost has been determined by calculating the variable costs for each aircraft during
the year, dividing that amount by the total number of miles flown by that aircraft, and multiplying the result by the miles flown for personal use during
the year. However, where there were identifiable costs related to a particular trip — such as fuel, airport landing fees or food and lodging for aircraft
personnel who remained at the location of the personal trip — those amounts are separately determined and included in the table above. The amounts
shown include incremental costs associated with flights to the hangar or other locations without passengers (commonly referred to as “deadhead”
flights) arising from the non-business use of the aircraft by a NEO. Beginning in 2021, Mr. Lance has entered into aviation lease agreements with the
company under which reimbursement, subject to FAA limitations, is provided for certain flights which are personal in nature. Amounts in the table
above reflect aggregate incremental cost net of reimbursements. Lease reimbursements are allocated to the flight to which they relate but may be
paid in a different year due to lease administration.

(b) ConocoPhillips executives participate in community, university, and philanthropic organizations at the request of the company. In some cases, company
aircraft are used to support these activities as well as other activities not integrally related to the performance of the executive’s duties. When these
activities are considered as not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive’s duties, we include the aggregate incremental cost
to ConocoPhillips in this column. The same guidelines for determining approximate aggregate incremental cost as discussed in note (a) are used in
determining these amounts.

(c) ConocoPhillips maintains a Matching Gift Program, under which certain gifts by employees to qualified educational or charitable institutions are
matched. For executives, the program matches up to $10,000 with regard to each program year. Administration of the program can cause us to pay
more than the limit in a single fiscal year due to a lag in processing claims.

(d) The amounts in this column represent other perquisites and personal benefits including the cost of presentations made to employees and their spouses
at Company meetings or events, reimbursements for the cost of spousal and other guests attendance at such meetings or events, and the aggregate
incremental cost of any other personal benefits or perquisites not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive’s duties arising
from such presentations, meetings, or events, primarily food, drink and transportation. Also includes any aggregate incremental cost of enhanced home
security, transportation security, and other protection services provided under our Comprehensive Security Program. As part of his duties and in addition
to working in the Houston headquarters of the company, Mr. Olds is required to work in the company’s Midland, Texas office which serves as a strategic
operational hub for its Permian Basin assets. Approximately 840 employees are based in this office. While working in Midland, Mr. Olds lived in a companypurchased house and drove a company-leased automobile. The amount shown for Mr. Olds includes the company’s actual cost of the house for the days
used by Mr. Olds and the company’s actual cost of leasing the automobile for the days used by Mr. Olds.

(e) The amounts shown reflect the cost of professional advice related to tax, estate and financial planning. The maximum benefit in 2023 was $15,000
plus any travel-related expenses incurred by the advisor when meeting with an executive. No tax gross-up is provided for these costs.

(f) Mr. Bullock was previously assigned in Singapore and Mr. Macklon was previously on the U.K. payroll assigned in the U.S. These amounts reflect net
expatriate benefits under our standard policies for such service outside of the employee’s home country, and these amounts include payments for
increased tax costs related to such expatriate assignments and benefits. Amounts shown in the table above also reflect amended tax equalization and
similar payments under our expatriate services policies that were made to and from, or on behalf of, the NEO that were paid or received during 2023,
but apply to earnings of prior years, but which were unknown or not capable of being estimated with any reasonable degree of accuracy in prior years.
These amounts are returned to ConocoPhillips when they are known or received through the tax reporting and filing process. Not included in the table
are amounts less than $0 that primarily relate to tax amounts returned to ConocoPhillips in the normal course of the expatriate tax protection process
that may relate to a prior period. The amount noted for Mr. Macklon would have been negative $29,112.


-----

(g) The amounts shown reflect the aggregate incremental cost of premiums paid by ConocoPhillips for executive group life insurance (coverage equal
to two times annual salary) versus the cost of basic life insurance provided to non-executive employees (coverage equal to annual salary). In addition,
certain employees, including the NEOs, are eligible to purchase group variable universal life insurance policies at no incremental cost to ConocoPhillips.

(h) The amounts shown are for payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the employee. These taxes arise primarily when ConocoPhillips
requests family members or other guests to accompany the employee to a function, and, as a result, the employee is deemed to make a personal use of
company assets (for example, when a spouse accompanies an employee on a company aircraft). ConocoPhillips believes such expenses are appropriately
characterized as a business expense, and, if the employee has imputed income in accordance with the applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips will generally
reimburse any increased tax costs.

(i) Under the terms of its tax-qualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes matching contributions and nonelective allocations to the accounts
of its eligible employees, including the NEOs.

(j) Under the terms of its nonqualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes contributions to the accounts of its eligible employees, including
the NEOs. See the narrative, table, and notes to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section beginning on page 107 for further information.

#### Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table

The Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table shows participation by the NEOs in the incentive compensation arrangements
described below.

The columns under the heading Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards show information
regarding VCIP. The amounts shown in the table are those applicable to the 2023 program year, using a minimum of zero
and a maximum of 200 percent of VCIP target for each participant; the amounts shown do not represent actual payouts
for that program year. Actual payouts for the 2023 program year were made in February 2024 and are shown in the
_Summary Compensation Table_ on page 98 under the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column. Awards are eligible
to be voluntarily deferred under the KEDCP.

The columns under the heading Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards show information regarding
PSP. The amounts shown in the table are those set for 2023 compensation tied to the 2023 through 2025 program period
and any promotional grants for previous performance periods and do not represent actual payouts for that program year.
These awards accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional restricted
stock units and paid upon the applicable vesting of the underlying award. Dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential
rates and are credited at the same time dividends are paid on common stock. Awards settled in cash are eligible to be
voluntarily deferred under the KEDCP. For the 2023 program year under the PSP, the HRCC set the targets and granted
awards at the regularly scheduled February 2023 meeting of the HRCC.

The All Other Stock Awards column reflects awards granted under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. The
Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program awards shown were granted on the same day the target was approved, vest
at the end of a three-year period, and accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested
in additional restricted stock units and settle in stock upon the applicable vesting of the underlying award. Dividend
equivalents are not paid at preferential rates and are credited at the same time dividends are paid on common stock.
For the 2023 program year under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, the HRCC set the targets and granted
awards at the regularly scheduled February 2023 meeting of the HRCC.

(1) The grant date shown is the date on which the HRCC approved the target awards or, in the case of prorated promotional awards under the PSP, the effective
date of the promotion. In the case of Mr. Bullock, his promotion was effective March 1, 2023.

(2) Threshold and maximum awards are based on the program provisions under VCIP. Actual awards earned can range from zero to 200 percent of the target
awards for corporate performance inclusive of negative discretionary adjustments for individual performance. Amounts reflect estimated cash payouts
under VCIP after the close of the performance period at the threshold, target, and maximum level of performance.

The estimated amounts are calculated based on the applicable annual target and base salary for each NEO in effect for the 2023 performance period,
including any salary increases during the year. While the program terms would also automatically adjust for salary decreases, these are not reflected in
the table above. If threshold levels of performance are not met, then the payout can be zero. The HRCC also retains the discretionary authority to make
negative individual performance adjustments to awards to NEOs under VCIP. Actual payouts under VCIP for 2023 are based on actual base salaries
earned in 2023 and are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98.

(3) Threshold and maximum awards under the PSP are based on the program provisions. Actual awards earned under the PSP can range from zero to 200
percent of the awards. Ms. Rose and Mr. Olds received an additional 10 percent initial award for PSP 23 (2023-2025) in recognition of their differential
performance in 2022.

(4) This reflects awards for the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Executive Restricted Stock Unit awards can only be adjusted downward.

(5) For equity incentive plan awards, these amounts represent the grant date fair value at target level under PSP as determined pursuant to FASB ASC
Topic 718 and reflected in the Stock Awards column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. Actual value realized upon vesting of the PSP or
Executive Restricted Stock Unit awards depends on market prices at the time of settlement for such awards. See the “Employee Benefit Plans” section
of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the relevant
assumptions used in this determination.

(1) All options shown in the table have a maximum term for exercise of ten years from the grant date. Under certain circumstances, the terms for exercise
may be shorter, and, in certain circumstances, the options may be forfeited and cancelled. All awards shown in the table have associated restrictions
on transferability.

(2) The options shown in this column vested and became exercisable in 2020 or prior years (although under certain termination circumstances, the options
may still be forfeited). Options became exercisable in one-third increments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date.

(3) Stock awards made to the NEOs in 2023 include: (a) long-term incentive awards under the PSP; or (b) long-term time-vested awards under the
Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Stock awards shown in the columns entitled Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested and
_Market Value of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested_ continue to have restrictions upon transferability. Stock awards shown reflect the closing
price of ConocoPhillips common stock ($116.07), as reported on the NYSE, on December 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023. The number of shares
or units shown is rounded to the nearest whole share, but the related value is based on the actual number of shares (including fractional shares), with
aggregate value rounded to the nearest dollar.

Amounts include PSP awards for the performance period that ended in December 2023 (PSP 21), shown at target. At its February 2024, meeting, the HRCC
approved final payout levels for the NEOs with regard to that performance period, as follows: Mr. Lance, 339,301 units; Mr. Bullock, 106,856 units; Ms. Rose,
73,017 units; Mr. Olds, 65,048 units; and Mr. Macklon, 75,201 units; see note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table. Under the PSP, stock awards are made
in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) or restricted stock, the former having been used in the most recent awards. The terms and conditions of both
are substantially the same, requiring restriction on transferability until separation from employment, although for performance periods beginning after
2008 and before 2013, restrictions will lapse five years from the anniversary of the grant date unless the employee has elected prior to the beginning of the
performance period to defer the lapsing of such restrictions until separation from employment. For performance periods beginning after 2012, restrictions
will lapse three years after the grant, and awards will be settled in cash. Except in cases where the five-year provision applies, forfeiture is expected to
occur if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service,
or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. Restricted stock awards have voting rights and pay dividends. RSU
awards have no voting rights. RSUs granted under PSP prior to 2018 pay dividend equivalents, but no dividend equivalents are paid or accrued for awards
made under the PSP until after the applicable performance period has ended. RSUs granted under the PSP in 2018 and later accrue dividend equivalents
that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional RSUs. Dividends or dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates, and dividend
equivalents are paid at the same time as dividends on common stock. Restricted stock held by the NEOs prior to November 17, 2001, was converted to
RSUs prior to the completion of the merger of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company, with the original restrictions still in place. Awards for ongoing
performance periods under PSP 22 (January 2022 –December 2024) and PSP 23 (January 2023 –December 2025)) are shown at target levels in the
columns entitled Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested, and Equity Incentive Plan Awards:
_Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested. There is no assurance that these awards will be granted at, below,_
or above target after the end of the relevant performance periods, as the determination of whether to make an actual grant and the amount of any actual
grant for NEOs is within the discretion of the HRCC.


-----

Amounts also include Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program awards granted in February 2021, 2022, and 2023. Under the Executive Restricted Stock
Unit Program, stock awards are made in the form of RSUs. The terms and conditions of those units require restriction on transferability, which lapse
three years from the anniversary of the grant date. Forfeiture is expected to occur at separation from service if the separation is not the result of death,
disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCC
has the authority to waive forfeiture. Upon lapse of restrictions, settlement is made in stock. RSU awards have no voting rights. Dividend equivalents, if
any, on RSUs held are reinvested in additional RSUs. Dividend equivalents are paid at the same time and the same rate as dividends on common stock,
not at a preferential rate. Awards under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program are shown in the columns entitled Number of Shares or Units of
_Stock That Have Not Vested._

Amounts also include restricted stock and RSU awards granted with respect to prior periods. The plans and programs under which such grants were
made provide that awards made in the form of restricted stock and RSUs be held in such form until the recipient retires (with respect to awards made
before 2009) or the earlier of eight years or retirement (with respect to awards made from 2009 through 2012), with the possible election to hold until
retirement, or three years (with regard to awards made in 2013 or later), with payouts for the last to be made in cash (unless voluntarily deferred to an
account in the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan). If such awards immediately vested upon completion of the relevant performance period as
is more typical for restricted stock programs, the amounts reflected in this column would be zero for awards made in years prior to 2012.

(4) Includes 6,780 restricted shares for LTIP X — PSP I initial payout, for which restrictions lapse at retirement; 106,204 RSUs related to grants for PSP I final
payout — PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service; 71,789 RSUs for PSP VIII and PSP VIII Tail; Mr. Lance elected to defer
lapsing of restrictions for PSP VIII and PSP VIII Tail until separation of service; 116,510 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions
lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; 57,087 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse
three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; 46,041 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three
years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; and 224,703 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. The actual payouts with
regard to the targets for PSP 21 were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Mr. Lance received a payout
of 339,301 units. Restrictions on the PSP 21 award lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have
elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP. For certain awards, Mr. Lance
has voluntarily elected to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation from service, and those awards continue to appear in the table. Subsequent
elections may also impact the final timing of the payout of these awards.

(5) Includes 24,356 RSUs related to grants for PSP I final payout — PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service; 31,177 Executive
RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from grant date and that will be settled in shares; 14,191 Executive RSUs
related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from grant date and that will be settled in shares; 11,655 Executive RSUs related
to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will be settled in shares; and 70,766 RSUs related to grants
for the PSP 21 target award. The actual payouts with regard to the targets for the PSP 21 award were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024
meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Mr. Bullock received a payout of 106,856 units. Restrictions on the PSP 21 award lapsed on February 13, 2024,
and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the
settlement deferred into the KEDCP. Subsequent elections may also impact the final timing of the payout of these awards.

(6) Includes 22,792 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that will be
settled in shares; 11,720 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that
will be settled in shares; 9,446 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will
be settled in shares; and 48,356 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. The actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 were
approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Ms. Rose received 73,017 units. Restrictions on the PSP 21 award
lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period,
to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP. Subsequent elections may also impact the final timing of the payout of these awards.

(7) Includes 16,731 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that will be
settled in shares; 9,061 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that
will be settled in shares; 8,362 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will
be settled in shares; 43,078 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. The actual payouts with regard to the targets for the PSP 21 award
were approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Mr. Olds received a payout of 65,048 units. Restrictions
on the PSP 21 award lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of
the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP. Subsequent elections may also impact the final timing of the
payout of these awards.

(8) Includes 24,380 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that will be
settled in shares; 11,098 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the program grant date and that
will be settled in shares; 9,115 Executive RSUs related to the grant in 2023, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date and that will
be settled in shares; and 49,802 RSUs related to grants for the PSP 21 target award. The actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 were
approved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting, and, pursuant to that decision, Mr. Macklon received 75,201 units. Restrictions on the PSP 21 award
lapsed on February 13, 2024, and the award settled in cash, although the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of the performance period,
to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP. Subsequent elections may also impact the final timing of the payout of these awards.

(9) Reflects potential RSU awards under ongoing performance periods for the PSP for the performance periods beginning January 2022 (Mr. Lance, 110,109
target units; Mr. Bullock, 36,477 target units; Ms. Rose, 25,993 target units; Mr. Olds, 21,909 target units; and Mr. Macklon, 23,701 target units) and
January 2023 (Mr. Lance, 88,800 target units; Mr. Bullock, 26,381 target units; Ms. Rose, 20,039 target units; Mr. Olds, 17,080 target units; and Mr. Macklon,
16,927 target units). There is no assurance that these awards will be granted at, below, or above target after the end of the relevant performance periods
because determination of whether to make an actual grant to, and the amount of any actual grant for, NEOs is within the discretion of the HRCC.

to have some or all of the settlement deferred into the KEDCP.

#### Pension Benefits

Our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. based employees is the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (“CPRP”). The CPRP
is intended to be tax-qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Our NEOs also participate in the
nonqualified ConocoPhillips Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (“KESRP”).

The CPRP consists of multiple titles with different terms, each corresponding to a different pension formula. NEOs are
only eligible to participate in one title at any time but may have frozen benefits under one or more other titles. Benefits
are identified by title in the table below, and all NEOs are vested in their benefits under the CPRP. Each title allows
for payment in the form of several annuity types or a single lump sum, but all of the options are considered actuarially
equivalent. Effective January 1, 2019, the CPRP was closed to additional benefit accrual for new hires and rehires who
instead are eligible for an enhanced benefit under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and a related make-up plan.

Normal retirement for all of the CPRP titles is defined as the later of age 65 or the employment termination date,
but participants in Title II may receive their vested benefits upon termination of employment at any age. Under Title I, early
retirement can occur at age 55 with five years of service. Under Title IV, early retirement can occur at age 50 with ten
years of service. Under Title I, early retirement benefits are unreduced for benefits that commence at or after age 60, but
are reduced by five percent per year (prorated by month) for each year before age 60 that benefits are paid. Under Title
IV, early retirement benefits are unreduced for benefits that commence at or after age 60, but are reduced by five percent
per year (prorated by month) for each year from age 50 to age 57 that benefits are paid before age 60 and four percent
per year (prorated by month) for each year from age 57 that benefits are paid before age 60. Messrs. Lance, Bullock, and
Olds were eligible for early retirement at the end of 2023 under the terms of Title I or Title IV, as applicable.

The annual pension benefit under Title I and Title IV is an amount payable in the form of a single life annuity beginning
at normal or early retirement equal to 1.6% multiplied by the participant’s pension compensation multiplied by years of
credited service, minus a Social Security benefit offset equal to 1.5% multiplied by the participant’s annual primary Social
Security benefit multiplied by years of credited service. For Title I, pension compensation is calculated using the three
highest consecutive years in the last ten years before retirement. For Title IV, pension compensation is calculated using the
higher of the highest consecutive 36- months of compensation or the highest nonconsecutive three years of compensation.


-----

Eligible pension compensation is limited to the annual maximum permitted under the Internal Revenue Code and
generally includes salary and annual incentive compensation and other items (such as overtime) that are not applicable
to or are not material for our NEOs. Under Title I, if an executive receives layoff benefits, eligible pension compensation
includes annualized salary for the year of layoff, rather than actual salary, and years of credited service are increased
by the layoff benefit period.

Pension benefits under Title II are based on monthly pay and interest credits to a notional cash balance account. Pay
credits are equal to a percentage of eligible pension compensation as described above. Participants whose combined
age and years of service total less than 44 receive a 6% pay credit, those whose combined age and years of service
total 44 through 65 receive a 7% pay credit, and those whose combined age and years of service total 66 or more
receive a 9% pay credit.

Mr. Macklon began participating in Title II of CPRP when he transferred to the U.S. payroll. Previously while he was on the
U.K. payroll, he participated in the ConocoPhillips Pension Plan (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan is a U.K. registered plan
with His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”). Mr. Macklon has a deferred, vested benefit under the noncontributory
portion of the U.K. Plan. Under applicable provisions of the U.K. Plan, a member is entitled to receive full benefits upon
attainment of normal pension age (60 in the case of Mr. Macklon) subsequent to termination. Early retirement may occur
after reaching age 55. Early retirement benefits are unreduced on and after age 60, but are actuarially reduced each
month before age 60 that benefits are paid. In general, annual pension benefits under the U.K. Plan are calculated as the
product of 1.75% of final pensionable salary multiplied by years of credited service. Final pensionable salary is generally
basic annual salary plus pensionable allowances earned in the 12 months before active membership in the U.K. Plan ends.
The U.K. Plan allows participants to choose between taking a full annuity or a reduced annuity plus a lump sum allowance
of up to 25 percent of the value of the benefit (capped at the greater of £268,275, or 25% of the protected lifetime
allowance in effect when the allowance was prospectively eliminated in 2023). Both choices are actuarially equivalent.

The KESRP is designed to replace benefits that would otherwise not be received due to certain voluntary reductions
of compensation under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan of ConocoPhillips (“KEDCP”) and to limitations
contained in the Internal Revenue Code that apply to the CPRP. The KESRP determines a benefit without regard to such
limits, and then reduces that benefit by the amount of benefit payable from the CPRP. Thus, in operation the combined
benefits payable from the related plans for an eligible employee equal the benefit that would have been paid if there
had been no KEDCP deferrals or limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For participants in Title I of the CPRP,
the KESRP pension compensation is calculated using the three highest annual amounts for salary and VCIP in the last
ten calendar years before retirement plus the year of retirement. Applicable pension compensation for participants in
Title II and Title IV of the CPRP, is calculated on the same basis as for the CPRP. Benefits under the KESRP are generally
paid in a single lump sum at the later of age 55 or six months after separation from service. When payment is made,
interest at then-current six-month Treasury-bill rates will be credited on any delayed benefits. Distribution may also be
made upon a determination of death or disability. Each of the NEOs who are eligible for benefits in the KESRP is vested.

Benefits due under the KESRP are paid from ConocoPhillips’ general assets, although we also maintain grantor trusts
that may be used to pay such benefits. The trusts and the funds held in them are assets of ConocoPhillips. In the event of
bankruptcy or insolvency of the company, trust assets would be held for the benefit of the company’s general creditors,
and participants would be unsecured general creditors.

For participants in the U.K. Plan, there is a plan similar to the KESRP, known as the ConocoPhillips Unfunded Pension
Plan (“U.K Unfunded Plan”), which operates on the same principles but with respect to limits imposed through HMRC
on registered plans like the U.K. Plan. Mr. Macklon is a participant in the U.K. Unfunded Plan with regard to the time
he worked in the U.K. from September 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016, at which time he transferred to the U.S. payroll
(Mr. Macklon was a participant in the U.K. Plan prior to September 1, 2013). Mr. Macklon is vested in his benefit under the
U.K. Unfunded Plan, and such benefit is payable when he attains 55 years of age in the form of a lump sum, or series of
lump sums payable over a five- or ten-year period.

Except where otherwise noted, assumptions used in calculating the present value of accumulated benefits in the table are
found in Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) Mr. Lance was previously an employee of ARCO Alaska, which was acquired by Phillips Petroleum Company in 2000. Mr. Lance’s Title I benefit
is calculated by including his 16 years of service with ARCO but then reducing the resulting benefit by amounts payable by the BP Retirement
Accumulation Plan which remains liable for his benefits accumulated while working for ARCO Alaska. This benefit including ARCO service and the
offset is payable because it exceeds the pension otherwise payable taking into account only ConocoPhillips service (and without the BP Retirement
Accumulation Plan offset).

(2) Ms. Rose became an employee of ConocoPhillips on September 4, 2018. Under Title II, and related provisions in the KESRP, Ms. Rose received pay credits
equal to seven percent of her pension compensation in 2023 because her combined age and years of service was 62.

(3) Mr. Macklon became an employee of ConocoPhillips on September 2, 1991. Under Title II, and related provisions in the KESRP, Mr. Macklon received pay
credits equal to 9 percent of his pension compensation in 2023 because his combined age and years of service exceed 65.

#### Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

Our NEOs participate in two nonqualified deferred compensation plans, the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan
of ConocoPhillips (“KEDCP”) and the Defined Contribution Make-Up Plan of ConocoPhillips (“DCMP”).

The KEDCP permits participants to defer up to 50% of base salary, 100% of VCIP and 100% of cash settled PSP awards for
performance periods ending in 2015 or later. Each of the NEOs is eligible to participate in, and is fully vested in, the KEDCP.
Under the KEDCP, participants may elect for payment of deferred amounts to begin one[(a)] to five years after separation
from service or on a specified date.[(b)] Payments may be received in a single lump sum payment or in annual, semiannual,
or quarterly installment payments over a period of one to 15 years.

The DCMP is a nonqualified restoration plan under which ConocoPhillips makes certain employer contributions that
cannot be made in the qualified ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (“CPSP”), a defined contribution 401(k) plan, due to certain
voluntary reductions of compensation under the KEDCP or due to compensation limitations imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code. Employees make no contributions to the DCMP, and each of the NEOs is fully vested in the DCMP. Under
the DCMP, participants may elect for payment of deferred amounts to begin one[(a)] to five years after separation from
service. Payments may be received in a single lump sum payment or in annual, semiannual, or quarterly payments over a
period of one to 15 years.

(a) Different distribution rules applied to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005. For these amounts payment could begin as early as immediately
following separation from service and certain changes to distribution elections are permitted. For amounts deferred under an election made prior to
2020, payments could begin as early as six months following separation from service.

(b) A date certain payment election is not permitted for salary earned before 2015.


-----

Each participant directs investments of the notional accounts representing deferrals under KEDCP and DCMP.
Participants may make changes in the notional investments at any time.

Because each participant chooses the notional investment fund for deferred amounts and may change allocations,
the return on the investment will depend on how well each underlying fund performs during the period the participant
chose it as an investment vehicle. The aggregate performance of such investment vehicle is reflected in the
_Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table_ under the column Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year.

Benefits due under each of the plans discussed above are paid from ConocoPhillips’ general assets, although we also
maintain grantor trusts that may be used to pay benefits under the plans. The trusts and the funds held in them are
assets of ConocoPhillips. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the company, trust assets would be held for the
benefit of the company’s general creditors, and participants would be unsecured general creditors.

(1) A variety of notional investments are available to participants in the KEDCP and DCMP. As of December 31, 2023, there were a total of 82 notional
investment options, 17 of which mirrored those available in ConocoPhillips’ primary tax-qualified defined contribution plan for employees (the
ConocoPhillips Savings Plan, a 401(k) plan) and 65 of which mirrored other mutual fund options approved by an administrator designated by the relevant
plan. As market-based investments, none of these provide above market returns.

(2) Reflects any deferrals by the NEO under the KEDCP in 2023.

(3) Reflects contributions by ConocoPhillips under the DCMP relating to eligible compensation earned in 2023 (included in the All Other Compensation
column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98 for 2023). The following amounts were contributed in January 2024, relating to company
contributions under the DCMP for 2023 service: for Mr. Lance, $43,775; for Mr. Bullock, $25,325; for Ms. Rose, $23,800; for Mr. Olds, $21,264; and for
Mr. Macklon, $22,751. In addition, contributions by ConocoPhillips under the DCMP in earlier years (included in the All Other Compensation column of
the Summary Compensation Table for those respective years) were as follows: in 2022 for Mr. Lance, $165,700; for Mr. Bullock, $77,827; for Ms. Rose,
$73,317; for Mr. Olds, $54,680; for Mr. Macklon, $65,225; in 2021 for Mr. Lance, $133,125; for Mr. Bullock, $64,958; for Ms. Rose, $58,497; for Mr.
Macklon, $55,569.

(4) None of these earnings are included in the Summary Compensation Table for 2023. Aggregate earnings reflect the net impact of notional investment
gains and losses and, consequently, may be a negative amount.

(5) Reflects contributions by our NEOs, contributions by ConocoPhillips, and earnings on balances prior to 2023; plus, contributions by our NEOs,
contributions by ConocoPhillips, and earnings for 2023; less any distributions (shown in the appropriate columns of this table, with amounts that are
included in the Summary Compensation Table for 2023 shown in notes 2 and 3 above). This also includes contributions by ConocoPhillips made in
January 2024, allocated to 2023. See note 3 above.

#### Executive Severance and Changes in Control

Salary and other compensation for our NEOs is set by the HRCC, as described in the “Compensation Discussion and
_Analysis”_ beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. These officers may participate in ConocoPhillips’ employee
benefit plans and programs for which they are eligible, in accordance with their terms. The amounts earned by the
NEOs for 2023 appear in the various Executive Compensation Tables beginning on page 98 of this Proxy Statement.

After separating from service each of our NEOs is expected to receive amounts earned while employed unless the
executive voluntarily resigns prior to becoming retirement-eligible or is terminated for cause. Such amounts include:

- VCIP compensation earned during the fiscal year;

- Grants pursuant to the PSP for the most-recently completed performance period and ongoing performance periods
in which the executive participated for at least one year;

- Previously granted restricted stock and restricted stock units;

- Vested stock option grants under the Stock Option Program;

- Amounts contributed and vested under our defined contribution plans; and

- Amounts accrued and vested under our retirement plans.

While normal retirement age under our benefit plans is 65, early retirement provisions allow benefits at earlier ages
if vesting requirements are met, as discussed in the sections of this Proxy Statement titled Pension Benefits and
_Nonqualified Deferred Compensation. For our compensation programs (VCIP, Stock Option Program, Executive RSU_
Program, and PSP), early retirement is generally defined to be termination at or after the age of 55 with five years
of service. As of December 31, 2023, Messrs. Lance and Bullock and Ms. Rose had met the early retirement criteria.
Messrs. Macklon and Olds, who were under the age of 55, and had not met the early retirement criteria at such date.

In addition, specific severance arrangements for executive officers, including the NEOs, are provided under two
severance plans: (1) the ConocoPhillips Executive Severance Plan (“CPESP”), which is available to a limited number
of senior executives; and (2) the ConocoPhillips Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan (“CICSP”), which is
also available to a limited number of senior executives but only on or following change in control. These arrangements
are described below. Executives are not entitled to participate in both plans as a result of a single event. For example,
executives receiving benefits under the CICSP would not be entitled to benefits potentially payable under the CPESP
relating to the event giving rise to benefits under the CICSP.


-----

###### ConocoPhillips Executive Severance Plan

The CPESP covers executives in salary grades generally corresponding to vice president and higher and is incorporated
by reference to Exhibit 10.47 to the Annual Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021;
File No. 001-32395. Under the CPESP, if ConocoPhillips terminates a plan participant other than for cause, as defined
in the plan, then upon executing a general release of liability and, if requested, an agreement not to compete with
ConocoPhillips, the participant will be entitled to:

- A lump-sum cash payment equal to one-and-a-half or two times the sum of the employee’s base salary and current
target VCIP award;

- For executives actively participating in the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (CPRP) and ConocoPhillips Key Employee
Supplemental Retirement Plan (KESRP), a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of the increase in pension
benefits that would result from the crediting of an additional one-and-a-half or two years to the employee’s number of
years of age and service under the applicable defined benefit pension formula under the plans;

- A lump-sum cash payment equal to ConocoPhillips’ cost of certain welfare benefits for an additional one-and-a-half
or two years;

- Continued eligibility for a pro rata portion of the annual VCIP for the year of termination; and

- Treatment as a layoff under our various compensation and equity programs. Generally, layoff treatment will allow full
or partial vesting of awards previously made and continued eligibility under ongoing ConocoPhillips programs. Thus,
Executive RSU awards would vest partially (for grants 6-12 months before the layoff) or fully (for grants more than
12 months before the layoff), and the executive would remain eligible for a pro rata proportion of awards attributable
to ongoing performance periods under the PSP in which the executive had participated for at least one year.

ConocoPhillips may amend or terminate the CPESP at any time. Amounts payable under the CPESP will be offset by any
payments or benefits that are payable to the severed employee under any other plan, policy, or program of ConocoPhillips
relating to severance, and amounts may also be reduced in the event of willful and bad faith conduct demonstrably
injurious to ConocoPhillips, monetarily or otherwise, or, if required by law to be “clawed back,” such as may be the case in
certain circumstances under the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy.

###### ConocoPhillips Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan

The CICSP covers executives in salary grades generally corresponding to vice president and higher and is incorporated by
reference to Exhibit 10.20.1 to the Annual Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; File
No. 001-32395. Under the CICSP, if within two years after a “change in control” of ConocoPhillips, a participant is terminated
by ConocoPhillips other than for cause, or by the participant for good reason (as such terms are defined in the plan), upon
executing a general release of liability, the participant will be entitled to:

- A lump-sum cash payment equal to two or three times the sum of the employee’s base salary and the higher of current
target VCIP compensation or the previous two years’ average VCIP compensation;

- For executives actively participating in the CPRP and KESRP, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of
the increase in pension benefits that would result from crediting an additional two or three years to the employee’s
number of years of age and service under the applicable defined benefit pension formula under the plans;

- A lump-sum cash payment equal to ConocoPhillips’ cost of certain welfare benefits for an additional two or three
years; and

- Continued eligibility for a pro rata portion of the annual VCIP compensation for the year of termination.

Excise tax gross-up benefits are not available under the CICSP.

Upon a change in control, awards that an acquirer assumes or substitutes will be subject to accelerated vesting only
following both the change in control and a qualifying termination of employment. A qualifying termination of employment
includes involuntary termination not-for-cause or voluntary termination for good reason. Participants will continue to be
able to exercise stock options for their remaining terms (up to 10 years from the date of grant).


-----

After a change in control, the CICSP may not be amended or terminated if such amendment would be adverse to the
interests of any eligible employee, without the employee’s written consent. Amounts payable under the plan will be
offset by any payments or benefits that are payable to the severed employee under any other plan, policy, or program
of ConocoPhillips relating to severance, and amounts may also be reduced in the event of willful and bad faith conduct
demonstrably injurious to ConocoPhillips, monetarily or otherwise, or if required by law to be “clawed back,” such as
may be the case in certain circumstances under the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy.

###### Quantification of Severance Payments

After separating from service each of our NEOs is expected to receive amounts earned during their period of employment
unless they voluntarily resign prior to becoming retirement-eligible or are terminated for-cause. The following tables
reflect the amount of incremental compensation payable in excess of the items listed above to each of our NEOs in the
event of involuntary not-for-cause termination, termination following a change in control (“CIC”) (either involuntarily
without cause or for good reason), and in the event of the death or disability of the executive. The amounts shown below
assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2023, and thus include amounts earned through such
time, and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. Amounts related
to Health and Welfare benefits are based on current ConocoPhillips benefit programs. The actual amounts to be paid
out can only be determined at the time of an executive’s separation from ConocoPhillips. In the event of a for-cause
termination, the HRCC can suspend the right to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of awards already requested,
or cancel awards granted if an NEO engages in any activity determined to be detrimental to ConocoPhillips. In addition,
the NEO’s incentive compensation is subject to the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy (see page 95 for more information).

- See notes below.

As discussed in the narrative preceding the tables above, the amounts shown indicate the difference in compensation
arising from the stated type of termination in comparison to a voluntary resignation. A NEO who voluntarily resigns before
reaching the retirement age and service eligibility threshold contained in those equity awards and compensation programs
(generally age 55 with 5 years of service) would not earn awards for ongoing performance periods under the VCIP, the PSP,
the Executive RSU Program, or the Stock Option Program (as applicable), and would lose prior awards under the PSP and
the Executive RSU Program (or other restricted stock or RSUs) and stock options. For a NEO who has reached retirement
eligibility under those programs, a voluntary resignation would be deemed a retirement, and thus would not typically result
in loss of those awards. However, before the awards are delivered as cash or stock (including upon the exercise of an
option), the awards remain at risk, even for a NEO who has reached retirement eligibility. If ConocoPhillips were to invoke
the detrimental activity clause, amounts that would normally be paid to a retirement-eligible NEO in connection with a
voluntary resignation would instead be forfeited.


-----

- **Notes Applicable to All Termination Tables — Benefits that would be available generally to all or substantially all salaried employees on the U.S. payroll**
are not included in the amounts shown on the previous page. In preparing the tables, we made the following assumptions:

   - **Base Salary — In the event of an involuntary not-for-cause termination not related to a change in control (“regular involuntary termination”), the**
amount reflects two times base salary. In the event of an involuntary not-for-cause or good reason termination related to a change in control (“CIC
termination”), the amount reflects three times base salary.

   - **Short-Term Incentives — In the event of a regular involuntary termination, the amount reflects two times the current VCIP target. In the event of a CIC**
termination, the amount reflects three times the current VCIP target or three times the average of the prior two VCIP payouts, whichever is greater.

   - **Variable Cash Incentive Program — In the event of a regular involuntary termination or a CIC termination, the amount reflects the employee’s pro**
rata current VCIP target. Targets for VCIP are for a full year and are pro rata for the NEOs based on time spent in their respective positions.

   - **PSP and RSUs — For the performance periods related to PSP, amounts for the January 2021 – December 2023 period reflect actual payout amounts**
that were awarded in February 2024, except in the event of a CIC termination, the amounts reflect the higher of target or actual payout, as the
award cannot be reduced following a change in control. Amounts for other ongoing PSP performance periods are shown at target, including any
adjustments for promotion or demotion made since the target awards were granted. For awards under the Executive RSU Program, amounts reflect
actual units granted. For restricted stock units awarded under PSP and Executive RSU Program, amounts reflect the closing price of ConocoPhillips
common stock on December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of 2023), as reported on the NYSE ($116.07).

   - **Incremental Retirement Values — For all NEOs, the amounts reflect the single sum, discounted to a present value, of the increment due to an**
additional two years of age and service with associated pension compensation in the event of a regular involuntary termination (three years in the
event of a CIC termination), regardless of whether the value is provided directly through a defined benefit plan or through the relevant severance plan.

### CEO Pay Ratio

ConocoPhillips’ compensation and benefits philosophy and the overall structure of our compensation and benefit
programs are designed to reward all employees who contribute to our success. We strive to ensure the compensation
of every employee reflects their talents, skills, responsibilities, and experience and is competitive within our peer group.
Compensation and benefits are benchmarked and set to be market-competitive in the employees’ home payroll country.
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ConocoPhillips is required to calculate and disclose the total
compensation paid to its median employee, as well as the ratio of total compensation paid to the median employee as
compared to the total compensation paid to the CEO. The paragraphs that follow describe our methodology and the
resulting CEO pay ratio.

The ratio of pay of the CEO compared to that of the median employee was approximately 101 to one in 2023. The annual total
compensation of the CEO was $20,789,282. The estimated median of the annual total compensation of all ConocoPhillips
employees other than the CEO, as represented by the annual total compensation of a median employee, was $205,547.
The compensation of the CEO and the median employee were determined using the same rules we followed in preparing
the Summary Compensation Table on page 98, except the compensation of the CEO and median employee were adjusted to
include nondiscriminatory health and welfare benefits totaling $18,609 and $16,764, respectively.

ConocoPhillips had approximately 10,045 employees worldwide (including intermittent and temporary employees) as
of the determination date (December 31, 2023). To identify the “median employee,” we excluded employees from six
countries, representing in total approximately 2.3 percent, or 233 employees worldwide. After excluding such employees
and the CEO, we determined the pay ratio using the remaining approximately 9,811 employees. The chart below shows
the countries from which employees were excluded and the approximate number of employees from each such country.

**Payroll Country Excluded** **Number of Employees Excluded**

Malaysia 86

China 81

Singapore 31

Qatar 24

Libya 9

Japan 2

For the remaining employees, we used a consistently applied compensation measure that management believes
reasonably reflects the annual compensation of employees and includes elements of compensation distributed widely
among employees. Those elements were base salary, overtime, annual incentive compensation (VCIP) at target, equity
awards, and certain country-specific allowances. We used data as of December 31, 2023, to identify ConocoPhillips
employees and to determine the consistently applied compensation measure for those employees. Data not denominated
in U.S. dollars was converted to U.S. dollars using an average monthly conversion rate for each denomination during 2023.
Data came from ConocoPhillips’ payroll records. We did not make any adjustments to the data to account for differences
in cost of living in any of the countries in which we have employees.

The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total
compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable
estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other
companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment
and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in
calculating their own pay ratios.

### Pay Versus Performance

Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ConocoPhillips is required to calculate and disclose in a tabular
format the “Compensation Actually Paid” (“CAP”) to the CEO and average CAP to all other NEOs. The rules also require
ConocoPhillips to disclose in the table the most important other financial performance measure that is measured over
the most recently completed year and that is used by the company to link company performance and compensation
(as reflected in CAP) to the NEOs for that year. We have determined that one-year relative Adjusted ROCE used for
purposes of evaluating the VCIP payout (see “Measuring Performance — Performance Peer Group” on page 83) is such
measure for 2023. Compensation decisions at ConocoPhillips are made in accordance with the philosophy and process
described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. CAP is a
supplemental measure defined by rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and does not necessarily reflect the
value actually realized by our executives. CAP does not replace the performance measures or philosophy and strategy
of compensation-setting discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (see pages 66-96).

a. The “service cost” is the actuarial present value of defined benefit pensions that is attributable to services rendered during the year. See “Pension Benefits”
starting on page 105 for a description of the formulas for the pension earned each year.

b. The “prior service cost” is the total additional cost of defined benefit pension benefits for prior years that is attributed to amendments during the year.
No such amendments were adopted effective in any of the years shown.

c. Amounts shown are based on the fair value of awards as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See the “Employee Benefit Plans”
section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the
relevant assumptions used in this determination. Amounts in the CAP Reconciliation Table (other than totals shown in the first and last rows) are
actual amounts rounded to the nearest dollar, and the total CAP is the sum of the amounts shown. In the following footnotes award descriptions are
rounded to the nearest share, and fair values are rounded to the nearest penny.

d. Includes PSP and ERSU award units granted during the year and unvested at year-end including award units related to dividend equivalents on
outstanding unvested awards reinvested in 2023, each with a fair value of $116.68 as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of 2023). In addition,
the incremental value includes projected PSP award units related to the 2021 PSP grant as adjusted for actual performance above target through
December 31, 2023. For these projected 2021 PSP awards above target, the incremental fair value as of December 29, 2023, equals $116.68 per share
because the 2021 PSP award only included target shares at the end of the prior year. The 2023 PSP awards and related reinvested dividend equivalents
are shown at target for the year of grant because that is the probable payout as of the end of that year. The 2021 PSP awards vesting and settling in
2024 are adjusted for actual performance because that is the probable payout based on performance through the end of the performance period
(ending December 31, 2023) even though the HRCC retained the discretion to adjust the payout until the time of settlement in February of 2024.

e. Includes the vesting date fair value of equity awards granted and vested during the year including ERSU award units granted in 2023 for which
restrictions were lapsed on November 30, 2023, to satisfy required tax withholding, with a fair value of $115.17 as of the vesting date, and award
units related to dividend equivalents on outstanding 2020 ERSU and PSP awards that were reinvested in 2023 and that vested February 19, 2023,
with a fair value of $104.92 as of the trading day immediately preceding the vesting date.

f. Includes the incremental reduction in fair value of unvested awards as of December 31, 2023, which were granted in previous years, including
restricted shares for LTIP VIII—PSP I initial payout, for which restrictions lapse at retirement; restricted stock units related to grants for PSP I final
payout—PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service; restricted stock units for PSP VIII and PSP VIII Tail for which Mr. Lance
elected to defer lapsing of restrictions until separation of service; restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2021, for which restrictions
lapse three years from the grant date; restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the
grant date; PSP award units related to the grant in 2021 based on initial target; and PSP award units related to the grant in 2022 based on initial target.
For these awards, the negative change in fair value equals the aggregate number of shares multiplied by minus $0.43, which is $116.68 (the fair value
of the company’s common stock as of December 29, 2023) less $117.11 (the fair value of the company’s common stock as of December 30, 2022).

g. Includes the incremental reduction in fair value of awards vesting in 2023, including PSP award units related to the grant in 2020 that settled in cash
based on performance as approved by the HRCC at its February 2023 meeting and restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2020 that
vested and settled in stock on February 19, 2023. For these awards, the negative change in fair value equals the aggregate number of shares multiplied
by minus $12.19, which is $104.92 (the fair value of the company’s common stock as of the trading date immediately preceding the February 19, 2023,
vesting date) less $117.11 (the fair value of the company’s common stock as of December 30, 2022).


-----

h. Includes the average of the Non-CEO NEOs’ year-end fair value of PSP and ERSU awards granted during the year and unvested at year end, including
award units related to dividend equivalents on outstanding unvested awards reinvested in 2023, each with a fair value of $116.68 as of December 29, 2023
(the last trading day of 2023). In addition, the average incremental value includes projected PSP award units related to the 2021 PSP grant as adjusted for
actual performance above target through December 31, 2023. For these projected 2021 PSP awards above target, the average incremental fair value as of
December 29, 2023, equals $116.68 per share because the 2021 PSP award only included target shares at the end of the prior year. The 2023 PSP awards
and related reinvested dividend equivalents are shown at target for the year of grant because that is the probable payout as of the end of that year. The
2021 PSP awards vesting and settling in 2024 are adjusted for actual performance because that is the probable payout based on performance through the
end of the performance period (ending December 31, 2023) even though the HRCC retained the discretion to adjust the payout until the time of settlement
in February of 2024.

i. Includes the average vesting date fair value of equity awards granted and vested during the year including ERSU award units granted in 2023 for
which restrictions were lapsed on November 30, 2023, to satisfy required tax withholding, with a fair value of $115.17 as of the vesting date, and
award units related to dividend equivalents on outstanding 2020 ERSU and PSP awards that were reinvested in 2023 and that vested February 19,
2023, with a fair value of $104.92 as of the trading day immediately preceding the vesting date.

j. Includes the average incremental reduction in fair value of unvested awards as of December 31, 2023, which were granted in previous years,
including restricted stock units related to grants for PSP I final payout—PSP VI, for which restrictions lapse following separation from service;
restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted in 2021, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date; restricted stock units
related to ERSU awards granted in 2022, for which restrictions lapse three years from the grant date; PSP award units related to the grant in 2021
based on initial target; and PSP award units related to the grant in 2022 based on initial target. For these awards, the negative change in the
average fair value equals the average aggregate number of shares multiplied by minus $0.43, which is $116.68 (the fair value of the company’s
common stock as of December 29, 2023) less $117.11 (the fair value of the company’s common stock as of December 30, 2022).

k. Includes the average incremental reduction in fair value of awards vesting in 2023, including PSP award units related to the grant in 2020 that settled
in cash based on performance as approved by the HRCC at its February 2023 meeting and restricted stock units related to ERSU awards granted
in 2020 that vested and settled in stock on February 19, 2023. For these awards, the negative change in the average fair value equals the average
aggregate number of shares multiplied by minus $12.19, which is $104.92 (the fair value of the company’s common stock as of the trading date
immediately preceding the February 19, 2023, vesting date) less $117.11 (the fair value of the company’s common stock as of December 30, 2022).

(4) The four NEOs included for the 2023 Average SCT Total for Non-CEO NEOs and the Average CAP for Non-CEO NEOs are: W.L. Bullock, Jr., D.E. Macklon,
N.G. Olds, and K.B. Rose. The five NEOs included for the 2022 Average SCT Total for Non-CEO NEOs and the Average CAP for Non-CEO NEOs are:
W.L. Bullock, Jr., T.A. Leach, D.E. Macklon, N.G. Olds, and K.B. Rose. The five NEOs included for the 2021 Average SCT Total for Non-CEO NEOs and the
Average CAP for Non-CEO NEOs are: W.L. Bullock, Jr., T.A. Leach, D.E. Macklon, M.J. Fox (retired effective July 1, 2021) and K.B. Rose. The five NEOs
included for the 2020 Average SCT Total for Non-CEO NEOs and the Average CAP for Non-CEO NEOs are: W.L. Bullock, Jr., M.J. Fox, D.E. Macklon,
K.B. Rose, and D.E. Wallette, Jr. (retired effective December 31, 2020).

(5) Company TSR shown for 2020 is the value as of December 31, 2020, of a hypothetical investment of $100 in ConocoPhillips stock on
December 31, 2019, with all dividends reinvested. The amount shown in 2021 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends
reinvested) as of December 31, 2021. The amount shown in 2022 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all dividends reinvested)
as of December 30, 2022 (the last trading day in 2022). The amount shown in 2023 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all
dividends reinvested) as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day in 2023).

(6) Peer Group TSR shown for 2020 is the value as of December 31, 2020, of a hypothetical investment of $100 in the stock of our performance peer
group on December 31, 2019, with all dividends reinvested. The amount shown in 2021 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with
all dividends reinvested) as of December 31, 2021. The amount shown in 2022 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with all
dividends reinvested) as of December 30, 2022 (the last trading day in 2022). The amount shown in 2023 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical
investment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day in 2023). For this purpose and for all years shown in the
table, our performance peer group consists of APA Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., ExxonMobil
Corporation, Hess Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, and Pioneer Natural Resources (see “Measuring Performance — Performance Peer
_Group” on page 83 for a description of how we select our performance peer group), and Peer Group TSR is weighted according to each peer’s stock_
market capitalization at the beginning of each annual period. While TSR for our peer group includes the S&P 500 Total Return Index for purposes of
certain compensation decisions as discussed in “Measuring Performance — Performance Peer Group” on page 83, in accordance with SEC regulations
the S&P 500 Total Return Index is not included in Peer Group TSR as shown in the table above. In October 2020, Chevron Corporation acquired Noble
Energy, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, Noble Energy, Inc. was a member of our performance peer group, but after the acquisition, we retained only the
combined company for the entire period so that Noble Energy, Inc. effectively ceased to be a member of the peer group retroactive to January 1, 2020.
In 2023, we updated our performance peer group, removing Marathon Oil Corporation and adding Pioneer, to better align with our business and market
capitalization. If we had not made these changes, the cumulative peer group TSR shown in the table above would have been $66.50 for 2020, $105.36
for 2021, $183.13 for 2022, and $167.11 for 2023.

(7) Relative Adjusted ROCE is measured as a percentile rank relative to peers over a one-year period as described in "Process for Determining Executive
_Compensation — Financial (VCIP and PSP)" and "Components of Executive Compensation — Performance-Based Pay Programs" on pages 82 and 75._

Note: As discussed under “Components of Executive Compensation — Performance-Based Pay Programs” on page 75, the
HRCC evaluates performance for purposes of PSP payouts using relative TSR and relative Adjusted ROCE measured over
a three-year performance period because a multi-year performance period helps to focus management on longer-term
results. Performance-based equity grants under the PSP are the largest individual component of target compensation
for the NEOs (see “Philosophy and Principles of our Executive Compensation Program — Pay for Performance” on page 73).
One-year relative Adjusted ROCE is used for purposes of evaluating VCIP payouts for 2020-2023 (see “Process for
_Determining Executive Compensation — Financial (VCIP and PSP)” on page 82), and was selected for comparison because_
it complies with SEC guidance that indicates multi-year performance measures should not be used in the Tabular List of
Performance Measures or as the company-selected measure in the Pay Versus Performance Table.


For purposes of this chart, relative Adjusted ROCE is calculated as described in footnote (7) on page 118.

### Stockholder Proposals

We expect Items 4 – 5 to be presented by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Following SEC rules, other than minor
formatting changes, we are reprinting the stockholder proposals and supporting statements, including any graphics,
as they were submitted to us. We take no responsibility for them. Upon oral or written request to the Secretary at the
address listed under How to Reach Our Corporate Secretary on page 129, we will provide the shareholdings (to our
company’s knowledge) of the proponents of any stockholder proposal presented at the Annual Meeting.

### Item 4: Stockholder Proposal — Simple Majority Vote

**Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Ave., 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, has notified ConocoPhillips that he intends to present**
**the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Steiner has indicated that he holds the requisite number of shares**
**of ConocoPhillips common stock in accordance with Rule 14a-8 requirements.**

#### What am I Voting On?

Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:

**Proposal 4 – Simple Majority Vote**

Shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and
bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be
replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in
compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and
against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes in plain English.

Shareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance.
Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively
related to company performance according to “What Matters in Corporate Governance” by Lucien Bebchuck,
Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives
supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management.

This proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs,
FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy’s. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders
had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at
the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG).

This proposal topic won 99% ConocoPhillips support as a shareholder proposal at the 2021 annual meeting. The next
step was to get binding shareholder approval as a Board of Directors proposal which required 80% approval from
every last share of ConocoPhillips stock. The outcome was a greatly disappointing narrow failure as the BOD proposal
received “only” 79% approval at the 2022 COP annual meeting.


-----

If ConocoPhillips Lead Director Robert Niblock had made a small effort to get an extra 1% shareholder vote this proposal
topic would have been approved in 2022. This narrow failure is evidence that Mr. Niblock does not give priority to the best
interests of shareholders and should thus be replaced as Lead Director. It will now take at least until 2025 to adopt this
proposal topic, with its 99% ConocoPhillips shareholder approval, that could have been easily adopted in 2022.

Please vote yes:
**Simple Majority Vote – Proposal 4**

###### What vote is required to approve this proposal?

Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

###### WHAT DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND?

Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws impose heightened voting requirements for a number of core governance
items, including “supermajority voting requirements” to amend sections of such documents. The Board believes that
there are advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the current voting requirements, and there are also advantages
and disadvantages to eliminating them. Accordingly, the Board will support the stockholder proposal and, provided
there is sufficient stockholder support, take steps to implement the proposal in the future.


-----

### Item 5: Stockholder Proposal — Revisit Pay Incentives for GHG Emission Reductions

**National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), located at 107 Park Washington Court, Falls Church, Virginia 22046,**
**has notified ConocoPhillips that they intend to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. NLPC**
**has indicated that it holds the requisite number of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock in accordance with**
**Rule 14a-8 requirements.**

#### What am I Voting On?

Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:

**Whereas: The “scientific consensus”[1]** [2] claims anthropogenically-driven climate change will result in catastrophic
impacts to the environment, to the planet, and to humans. However, research increasingly shows worst-case
scenarios are unlikely, and the potential consequences of carbon dioxide emissions (aka “plant food”) have been
greatly overstated.[3] For example:

- Corporate climate policy is often guided by the Paris Agreement, which is heavily informed by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[4] These targets are neither legally binding nor legitimized by
scientific evidence.

- The IPCC’s most extreme scenario unrealistically assumes a return to a previous era of unrestricted fossil fuel
usage and heavy reliance on coal power.[5] This extreme scenario is unlikely now that most nations have climate
policies in place.[6]

- Regarding catastrophic scenarios that are highly unlikely but are treated as the expectation, “the media then
often amplifies this message, sometimes without communicating the nuances. This results in further confusion
regarding probable emissions outcomes, because many climate researchers are not familiar with the details of
these scenarios in the energy-modeling literature.”[7]

- These apocalyptic predictions have been repeatedly proven false.[8] Climate models used to predict future
events “may be overly sensitive to carbon dioxide increases and therefore project future warming that is
unrealistically high.”[9]

- When given historical data, climate models project impossibly high temperatures that are inconsistent with fossil
evidence—yet they’re still used by the IPCC.

- Hydrocarbons are reliable and cost-efficient. Renewable energy will not replace hydrocarbons in the near future,
if ever.[10] ConocoPhillips Company’s (“ConocoPhillips” or the “Company”) competitors are betting big on continued
demand for oil and gas.[11]

**Supporting Statement: Despite the evidence that climate alarmism is overstated, ConocoPhillips’s executive pay**
program incorporates unnecessary incentives to assumed combat climate change.

- According to the Company’s 2023 Proxy Statement, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee set a
Variable Cash Incentive Program target of 14 percent of total compensation for the CEO and 16 percent for other
Named Executive Officers.[12]

- “Strategic and ESG Milestones” are one of the five metrics used to determine VCIP for NEOs. These
milestones include:

  - “Demonstrated meaningful progress toward our Paris-aligned climate risk framework.”

  - “Progressed our long-term strategy by establishing new methane and flaring targets, executing emission
reduction projects, and progressing CCS business development opportunities.”

These VCIP metrics are unscientific and create a breach of fiduciary duty. ConocoPhillips is an oil and gas company
and should focus on what it does best. The company cannot afford to be left behind because of misguided executive
pay incentives.

**Resolved: Shareholders of ConocoPhillips request the Board of Directors’ Human Resources and Compensation**
Committee to revisit its incentive guidelines for executive pay, to emphasize legitimate fiduciary goals and consider
eliminating greenhouse gas reduction targets and other scientifically dubious goals from compensation inducements.

###### What vote is required to approve this proposal?

Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

###### WHAT DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND?

**The Board recommends you vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:**

The Board has carefully considered the recommendations set forth in the proposal and we believe the changes
suggested are not in the best interest of ConocoPhillips or our stockholders for the following reasons:

**_Our executive compensation is aligned with our company strategy and with the long-term interests of_**
**_our stockholders._**

ConocoPhillips continues to be guided by our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles
while executing against our Triple Mandate, which sets out three objectives to align our actions with the underlying
realities of our business and demonstrates our commitment to create long-term value for our stockholders. Our Triple
Mandate includes reliably and responsibly delivering oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand,
delivering returns on and of capital for our stockholders, and remaining focused on achieving our net-zero operational
emissions ambition. Consistent with our philosophy of aligning our executive compensation programs with company
strategy and with the long-term interests of our stockholders, our executive compensation programs and metrics remain
aligned with our value proposition and Triple Mandate (see page 72).

**_An overwhelming majority of our stockholders have expressed a desire for us to link compensation with our_**
**_climate commitments._**

We regularly meet with stockholders on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation programs. In recent
years, during these engagements, an overwhelming majority of stockholders have sought to confirm how we link
progress on our climate commitments to our executive compensation programs. Recently, ConocoPhillips created a
separately weighted measure (10 percent) for “Energy Transition Milestones,” for our short-term incentive program (see
page 82), and almost all of our stockholders supported our modified compensation program. For more information on
our stockholder engagement, see “Stockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness” beginning on page 45 and “2023
_Say on Pay Vote Result, Stockholder Engagement, and Board Responsiveness” beginning on page 69._

###### AGAINST For the foregoing reasons, the Board recommends you vote AGAINST this stockholder proposal.

_www.conocophillips.com/annualmeeting._

###### What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial stockholder?

If your shares are registered directly in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our registrar and transfer
agent, you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a brokerage
account or bank, you are considered the “beneficial owner” or “street name” holder of those shares.

Brokers may use their discretion to vote shares held in street name on matters considered “routine” under NYSE rules.
Brokers may not vote shares held in street name on non-routine matters unless they have received voting instructions
from the beneficial owners. Shares that are not voted on non-routine matters are called broker non-votes.

If you return a signed proxy card without indicating your vote, your shares will be voted “FOR” each of the director
nominees listed on the card, “FOR” the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as ConocoPhillips’ independent registered
public accounting firm, “FOR” the approval of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, “FOR” the
stockholder proposal on simple majority vote and “AGAINST” the stockholder proposal to Revisit Pay Incentives for GHG
Emissions Reductions.

###### Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy and do not participate in the Annual Meeting?

If you are a record owner and do not provide a proxy or vote your shares during the meeting, your shares will not
be voted.

If you hold your shares in street name, your broker has the authority to vote your shares for certain routine matters
even if you do not provide voting instructions. This year, only the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent
registered public accounting firm for 2024 is considered a routine matter. If you do not give your broker instructions on
how to vote your shares on other matters, the broker cannot vote on those proposals, resulting in a broker non-vote.

As more fully described on your proxy card, if you hold your shares through certain ConocoPhillips employee benefit
plans and do not vote your shares, your shares (along with all other shares in the plan for which votes are not cast) may
be voted pro rata by the trustee in accordance with the votes directed by other participants in the plan.

###### How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted?

Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Otherwise, broker non-votes
will have no effect on the vote for any proposal. In contrast, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
a proposal.

###### Can I change my vote?

You can change your vote at any time before the polls close at the Annual Meeting. You can do this by:

- Voting again by telephone or over the Internet prior to 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 13, 2024;

- Signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the meeting; or

- Voting again during the meeting.

###### Who counts the votes?

We have hired Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to count the votes represented by proxies and cast by ballot.
James D. Gaughan of Gaughan ADR has been appointed to act as Inspector of Election.

###### When will the voting results be announced?

We will announce the preliminary voting results during the Annual Meeting. We will report the final results on our
website and in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the meeting.

###### Will my vote be confidential?

All stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify stockholders will be maintained in confidence. No such
document will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder will not be disclosed, except
as necessary to meet legal requirements and to allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of the vote.
Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to management.

#### Business to Take Place at the Meeting

###### How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting?

you participate in the meeting and vote electronically, or if you properly return a proxy by Internet, telephone, or mail.

###### Which proposals to be voted on at the meeting are considered “routine” and which are “non-routine”?

The ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024 is the only routine
matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting, and the only matter on which brokers may vote on behalf of beneficial
owners who have not provided voting instructions.

All other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting are non-routine. Brokers will not be allowed to vote on these
other proposals without specific voting instructions from beneficial owners.

###### How many votes are needed to approve each of the proposals?

Each of the director nominees and all proposals submitted require the affirmative “FOR” vote of a majority of those
shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

###### Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?

We are not aware of any other matters to be presented at the meeting. If any matters are properly brought before
the Annual Meeting, the individuals named in your signed proxy are authorized to vote in accordance with their
best judgment.

###### Is there a policy about attendance by directors at the Annual Meeting?

Directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of the individuals who were seeking reelection
attended the 2023 annual meeting.

#### Proxies

###### Who is soliciting my proxy?

The Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

###### How can I revoke my proxy?

You can revoke your proxy by sending written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary so that it is received prior
to the close of business on May 13, 2024.


-----

###### What is the cost of this proxy solicitation?

Our directors, officers, and employees may solicit proxies by mail, by email, by telephone, or in person. Those individuals
will receive no additional compensation for solicitation activities. We will request banking institutions, brokerage firms,
custodians, trustees, nominees, and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of common
stock held of record by those entities, and we will, upon request, reimburse reasonable forwarding expenses. We will
pay the costs of preparing, printing, assembling, and mailing the proxy materials used in the solicitation of proxies.
In addition, we have hired Alliance Advisors to assist us in soliciting proxies, which it may do by mail, telephone, or in
person. We anticipate paying Alliance Advisors a fee of $20,000, plus expenses.

#### Ways to Get Our Proxy Statement and Annual Report

###### How can I access ConocoPhillips’ proxy materials and Annual Report electronically?

This Proxy Statement, the accompanying proxy card, and our 2023 Annual Report are available to stockholders online
at www.proxyvote.com.

Most stockholders can elect to view future proxy statements and annual reports online instead of receiving paper
copies in the mail. If you are a record owner of ConocoPhillips stock, you can choose this option and save us the cost
of producing and mailing these documents by following the instructions on your proxy card or those provided when
you vote by telephone or over the Internet. If you hold your ConocoPhillips stock in street name, please refer to the
information provided by your broker for instructions on how to elect to view future proxy statements and annual
reports electronically.

If you choose to view future proxy statements and annual reports electronically, you will receive a Notice of Internet
Availability next year in the mail containing the applicable Internet address. Your choice will remain in effect unless
you change it; you do not have to elect Internet access each year. If you change your mind and would like to receive
paper copies of our proxy statements and annual reports, you can request both by phone at (800) 579-1639, by email
[at sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, and online at www.proxyvote.com. You will need the 16-digit control number located](mailto:?subject=)
on your Notice of Internet Availability to request a package. You will also have an opportunity to request future proxy
statements and annual reports by mail.

###### Why did my household receive a single set of proxy materials?

SEC rules permit us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household at which two or
more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. This benefits both you and
ConocoPhillips, as it eliminates duplicate mailings and reduces our printing and mailing costs. Each stockholder will
continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card.

Your household may have received a single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now
or in future years, please request a duplicate set by phone at (800) 579-1639, online at www.proxyvote.com, or by email
[at sendmaterial@proxyvote.com.](mailto:?subject=)

If you hold your stock in street name, you may receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers will eliminate duplicate
account mailings on request. You may need to contact your broker directly if you want to discontinue duplicate mailings
to your household.

### Appendix A

#### Non-GAAP Financial Measures

###### Adjusted Earnings

Adjusted Earnings is calculated by removing the impact of special items from reported earnings. Special items are
items that management believes are unusual or nonrecurring and not indicative of our core operating results or
business outlook over the long term. Management believes adjusted earnings is useful to investors in evaluating our
operating results, understanding our operating trends across periods on a consistent basis, and providing comparability
with the performance of peer companies.

###### Adjusted EPS

Adjusted EPS is a measure of the company’s diluted net earnings per share excluding special items. Special items
are items that management believes are unusual or nonrecurring and not indicative of our core operating results
or business outlook over the long term. Management believes adjusted earnings per share is useful to investors in
evaluating our operating results, understanding our operating trends across periods on a consistent basis and providing
comparability with the performance of peer companies.

###### Cash from Operations (CFO)

Cash from operations (CFO) is calculated by removing the impact from operating working capital from cash provided
by operating activities. The company believes that the non-GAAP measure cash from operations is useful to investors
to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the impact of working capital changes
across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in
combination with the company’s results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of
the factors and trends affecting the company’s business and performance.

###### Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations net of capital expenditures and investments. The company believes
free cash flow is useful to investors in understanding how existing cash from operations is utilized as a source for
sustaining our current capital plan and future development growth. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for
discretionary expenditures since the company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are
not deducted from the measure.

###### Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a measure of the profitability of the company’s capital employed in its business
operations compared with that of its peers. The company calculates ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is net
income, and the denominator of which is average total equity plus average total debt. The net income is adjusted for
after-tax interest expense, for the purposes of measuring efficiency of debt capital used in operations; net income
is also adjusted for non-operational or special items impacts to allow for comparability in the long-term view across
periods. The company believes ROCE is a good indicator of long-term company and management performance as it
relates to capital efficiency, both absolute and relative to the company’s primary peer group.

#### Other Measures

###### Resources

Based on the Petroleum Resources Management System, a system developed by industry that classifies recoverable
hydrocarbons into commercial and sub-commercial to reflect their status at the time of reporting. Proved, probable,
and possible reserves are classified as commercial, while remaining resources are categorized as sub-commercial
or contingent. The company’s resource estimate includes volumes associated with both commercial and contingent
categories. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and
possible reserves. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other
reports and filings with the SEC.

###### Cost of Supply

Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully
burdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price-related inflation, G&A, and
carbon tax (if currently assessed). If no carbon tax exists for the asset, carbon pricing aligned with internal energy
scenarios is applied. All barrels of resource in the cost of supply calculation are discounted at 10 percent.
